ANSI_X3.4-1968 (canonical name)
iso-ir-6
ANSI_X3.4-1986
ISO_646.irv:1991
ASCII
ISO646-US
US-ASCII (preferred MIME name)[12]
us
IBM367
cp367
csASCII
Of these, the IANA encourages use of the name "US-ASCII" for Internet uses of ASCII (even if it is a redundant acronym, but the US is needed because of abuse of the ASCII term). One often finds this in the optional "charset" parameter in the Content-Type header of some MIME messages, in the equivalent "meta" element of some HTML documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some XML documents.
