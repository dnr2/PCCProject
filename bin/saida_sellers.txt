texto.txt:corin	i partly guess; for i have loved ere now.

texto.txt:orlando	fair youth, i would i could make thee believe i love.
texto.txt:	love believe it; which, i warrant, she is apter to

texto.txt:	o sweet oliver,
texto.txt:	o brave oliver,
texto.txt:sir oliver martext	'tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them
texto.txt:	horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, i do
texto.txt:	think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
texto.txt:rosalind	not true in love?
texto.txt:celia	'was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
texto.txt:	his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
texto.txt:	after the shepherd that complain'd of love,
texto.txt:	between the pale complexion of true love
texto.txt:rosalind	o, come, let us remove:
texto.txt:	the sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
texto.txt:	i'll prove a busy actor in their play.

texto.txt:	than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
texto.txt:	that love's keen arrows make.
texto.txt:	over the wretched? what though you have no beauty,--
texto.txt:	and thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
texto.txt:	cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
texto.txt:rosalind	he's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
texto.txt:	fall in love with my anger. if it be so, as fast as
texto.txt:rosalind	i pray you, do not fall in love with me,
texto.txt:	'tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
texto.txt:	'who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'
texto.txt:	if you do sorrow at my grief in love,
texto.txt:	by giving love your sorrow and my grief
texto.txt:phebe	thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?
texto.txt:phebe	                  why, that were covetousness.
texto.txt:	and yet it is not that i bear thee love;
texto.txt:	but since that thou canst talk of love so well,
texto.txt:silvius	so holy and so perfect is my love,
texto.txt:	and i in such a poverty of grace,
texto.txt:	a scatter'd smile, and that i'll live upon.
texto.txt:phebe	think not i love him, though i ask for him:
texto.txt:	to fall in love with him; but, for my part,
texto.txt:	i love him not nor hate him not; and yet
texto.txt:	i have more cause to hate him than to love him:

texto.txt:	would prove: my friends told me as much, and i
texto.txt:	pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
texto.txt:celia	you have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
texto.txt:	we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your

texto.txt:	am in love. i'll tell thee, aliena, i cannot be out
texto.txt:celia	i warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he

texto.txt:	that this foul deed shall smell above the earth
texto.txt:	romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my

texto.txt:	--not that i loved caesar less, but that i loved
texto.txt:	die all slaves, than that caesar were dead, to live
texto.txt:	all free men? as caesar loved me, i weep for him;
texto.txt:	slew him. there is tears for his love; joy for his
texto.txt:	vile that will not love his country? if any, speak;
texto.txt:	i depart,--that, as i slew my best lover for the

texto.txt:brutus	good countrymen, let me depart alone,

texto.txt:	the evil that men do lives after them;
texto.txt:	i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke,
texto.txt:	you all did love him once, not without cause:
texto.txt:	i found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
texto.txt:	it is not meet you know how caesar loved you.
texto.txt:	that day he overcame the nervii:
texto.txt:	through this the well-beloved brutus stabb'd;
texto.txt:	judge, o you gods, how dearly caesar loved him!
texto.txt:	whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
texto.txt:	let not a traitor live!
texto.txt:	that love my friend; and that they know full well
texto.txt:	in every wound of caesar that should move
texto.txt:	wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves?
texto.txt:antony	moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
texto.txt:	how i had moved them. bring me to octavius.
texto.txt:lepidus	upon condition publius shall not live,
texto.txt:antony	he shall not live; look, with a spot i damn him.
texto.txt:	i do appoint him store of provender:

texto.txt:	how covert matters may be best disclosed,
texto.txt:	when love begins to sicken and decay,
texto.txt:	which should perceive nothing but love from us,
texto.txt:	let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
texto.txt:	go show your slaves how choleric you are,
texto.txt:cassius	when caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
texto.txt:cassius	do not presume too much upon my love;
texto.txt:	when marcus brutus grows so covetous,
texto.txt:cassius	you love me not.
texto.txt:	revenge yourselves alone on cassius,
texto.txt:	hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
texto.txt:	when thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
texto.txt:	than ever thou lovedst cassius.
texto.txt:cassius	hath cassius lived
texto.txt:cassius	have not you love enough to bear with me,

texto.txt:brutus	well, to our work alive. what do you think
texto.txt:	or lose our ventures.
texto.txt:	i will not hold thee long: if i do live,

texto.txt:	lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
texto.txt:	if we do lose this battle, then is this
texto.txt:	that govern us below.
texto.txt:cassius	then, if we lose this battle,
texto.txt:	and sudden push gives them the overthrow.
texto.txt:	whilst we by antony are all enclosed.

texto.txt:	of lewis the dauphin and that lovely maid:
texto.txt:	if lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
texto.txt:	if zealous love should go in search of virtue,
texto.txt:	if love ambitious sought a match of birth,
texto.txt:	to our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
texto.txt:	can in this book of beauty read 'i love,'
texto.txt:	i do protest i never loved myself
texto.txt:	himself love's traitor: this is pity now,
texto.txt:	in such a love so vile a lout as he.
texto.txt:	that any thing he sees, which moves his liking,
texto.txt:	i will enforce it easily to my love.
texto.txt:	that all i see in you is worthy love,
texto.txt:king john	speak then, prince dauphin; can you love this lady?
texto.txt:lewis	nay, ask me if i can refrain from love;
texto.txt:	for i do love her most unfeignedly.
texto.txt:king philip	it likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
texto.txt:	who, having no external thing to lose
texto.txt:	that give you cause to prove my saying true.
texto.txt:	for then i should not love thee, no, nor thou
texto.txt:	to tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
texto.txt:	and leave those woes alone which i alone
texto.txt:	proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
texto.txt:	that bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
texto.txt:	upon my party! thou cold-blooded slave,
texto.txt:	and dost thou now fall over to my fores?
texto.txt:	where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
texto.txt:	yet i alone, alone do me oppose
texto.txt:	and by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.
texto.txt:	which only lives but by the death of faith,
texto.txt:	that faith would live again by death of need.

texto.txt:	and, by my troth, i think thou lovest me well.
texto.txt:hubert	                  he shall not live.
texto.txt:	i could be merry now. hubert, i love thee;
texto.txt:	death, death; o amiable lovely death!

texto.txt:	like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
texto.txt:lewis	and lose it, life and all, as arthur did.
texto.txt:	i were your son, so you would love me, hubert.
texto.txt:	i warrant i love you more than you do me.
texto.txt:	or 'what good love may i perform for you?'
texto.txt:	and ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
texto.txt:	nay, you may think my love was crafty love
texto.txt:hubert	go, stand within; let me alone with him.
texto.txt:hubert	none, but to lose your eyes.
texto.txt:hubert	well, see to live; i will not touch thine eye
texto.txt:hubert	silence; no more: go closely in with me:

texto.txt:	your highness should deliver up your crown.
texto.txt:	deliver him to safety; and return,

texto.txt:	by slaves that take their humours for a warrant
texto.txt:	young arthur is alive: this hand of mine
texto.txt:	is yet the cover of a fairer mind

texto.txt:	o, answer not, but to my closet bring
texto.txt:	i am afraid; and yet i'll venture it.
texto.txt:	whose private with me of the dauphin's love
texto.txt:	and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
texto.txt:	arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.
texto.txt:hubert	do not prove me so;
texto.txt:	i honour'd him, i loved him, and will weep
texto.txt:	i am amazed, methinks, and lose my way
texto.txt:	your sovereign greatness and authority.

texto.txt:	or overthrow incurable ensues.
texto.txt:	but dover castle: london hath received,
texto.txt:	after they heard young arthur was alive?
texto.txt:king john	that villain hubert told me he did live.

texto.txt:	what, here? o nation, that thou couldst remove!
texto.txt:	to any sovereign state throughout the world.
texto.txt:	am i rome's slave? what penny hath rome borne,
texto.txt:	in spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
texto.txt:	dear amity and everlasting love.

texto.txt:	even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
texto.txt:	the love of him, and this respect besides,
texto.txt:	but i do love the favour and the form
texto.txt:	yet speaks and peradventure may recover.
texto.txt:	and tempt us not to bear above our power!
texto.txt:	as i upon advantage did remove,

texto.txt:did livery falseness in a pride of truth.
texto.txt:and controversy hence a question takes,

texto.txt:adriano de armado	green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
texto.txt:	love of that colour, methinks samson had small reason
texto.txt:adriano de armado	my love is most immaculate white and red.
texto.txt:	boy, i do love that country girl that i took in the
texto.txt:moth	[aside]  to be whipped; and yet a better love than

texto.txt:sir nathaniel	very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony
texto.txt:holofernes	the deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
texto.txt:sir nathaniel	truly, master holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
texto.txt:holofernes	sir nathaniel, haud credo.
texto.txt:holofernes	most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
texto.txt:holofernes	twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
texto.txt:	many can brook the weather that love not the wind.
texto.txt:holofernes	dictynna, goodman dull; dictynna, goodman dull.
texto.txt:holofernes	the moon was a month old when adam was no more,
texto.txt:holofernes	god comfort thy capacity! i say, the allusion holds
texto.txt:holofernes	sir nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
texto.txt:sir nathaniel	perge, good master holofernes, perge; so it shall
texto.txt:holofernes	i will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
texto.txt:holofernes	this is a gift that i have, simple, simple; a

texto.txt:holofernes	mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
texto.txt:holofernes	master parson, quasi pers-on. an if one should be
texto.txt:holofernes	piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
texto.txt:holofernes	fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
texto.txt:	not, loves thee not. ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
texto.txt:holofernes	let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.
texto.txt:	if love make me forsworn, how shall i swear to love?
texto.txt:	though to myself forsworn, to thee i'll faithful prove:
texto.txt:	where all those pleasures live that art would
texto.txt:	thy eye jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
texto.txt:	celestial as thou art, o, pardon, love, this wrong,
texto.txt:holofernes	you find not the apostraphas, and so miss the

texto.txt:	love's labours lost
texto.txt:	proved, wit! by the lord, this love is as mad as
texto.txt:	well proved again o' my side! i will not love: if
texto.txt:	love her; yes, for her two eyes. well, i do nothing
texto.txt:	heaven, i do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
texto.txt:	but do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
texto.txt:ferdinand	in love, i hope: sweet fellowship in shame!
texto.txt:biron	one drunkard loves another of the name.
texto.txt:	the shape of love's tyburn that hangs up simplicity.
texto.txt:longaville	i fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:
texto.txt:	o sweet maria, empress of my love!
texto.txt:	a woman i forswore; but i will prove,
texto.txt:	my vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
texto.txt:	to lose an oath to win a paradise?
texto.txt:biron	this is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
texto.txt:biron	once more i'll mark how love can vary wit.
texto.txt:	love, whose month is ever may,
texto.txt:	that the lover, sick to death,
texto.txt:	thou for whom jove would swear
texto.txt:	and deny himself for jove,
texto.txt:	turning mortal for thy love.
texto.txt:	that shall express my true love's fasting pain.
texto.txt:	were lovers too! ill, to example ill,
texto.txt:longaville	[advancing]  dumain, thy love is far from charity.
texto.txt:	you do not love maria; longaville
texto.txt:	his loving bosom to keep down his heart.
texto.txt:	i have been closely shrouded in this bush
texto.txt:	ay me! says one; o jove! the other cries;
texto.txt:	and jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
texto.txt:	good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
texto.txt:	these worms for loving, that art most in love?
texto.txt:	are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?
texto.txt:	or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
texto.txt:biron	i post from love: good lover, let me go.
texto.txt:ferdinand	biron, read it over.
texto.txt:longaville	it did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.
texto.txt:	are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
texto.txt:biron	sweet lords, sweet lovers, o, let us embrace!
texto.txt:ferdinand	what, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
texto.txt:	my love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
texto.txt:	o, but for my love, day would turn to night!
texto.txt:	of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
texto.txt:ferdinand	   by heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
texto.txt:biron	i'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.
texto.txt:longaville	   look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
texto.txt:	the street should see as she walk'd overhead.
texto.txt:ferdinand	but what of this? are we not all in love?
texto.txt:ferdinand	then leave this chat; and, good biron, now prove
texto.txt:	our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.
texto.txt:	but love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
texto.txt:	lives not alone immured in the brain;
texto.txt:	above their functions and their offices.
texto.txt:	a lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
texto.txt:	a lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
texto.txt:	love's feeling is more soft and sensible
texto.txt:	love's tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste:
texto.txt:	for valour, is not love a hercules,
texto.txt:	and when love speaks, the voice of all the gods
texto.txt:	until his ink were temper'd with love's sighs;
texto.txt:	else none at all in ought proves excellent.
texto.txt:	or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
texto.txt:	for wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
texto.txt:	or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
texto.txt:	let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
texto.txt:	or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
texto.txt:	and who can sever love from charity?
texto.txt:longaville	now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
texto.txt:	forerun fair love, strewing her way with flowers.
texto.txt:	light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
texto.txt:	love's labours lost

texto.txt:	for who love i so much? and now who knows
texto.txt:	but you, lorenzo, whether i am yours?
texto.txt:lorenzo	heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
texto.txt:	but love is blind and lovers cannot see
texto.txt:lorenzo	descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
texto.txt:	why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;

texto.txt:	there's something tells me, but it is not love,
texto.txt:	i would not lose you; and you know yourself,

texto.txt:	for as i am, i live upon the rack.
texto.txt:	what treason there is mingled with your love.
texto.txt:	which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:

texto.txt:lysander	you have her father's love, demetrius;
texto.txt:egeus	scornful lysander! true, he hath my love,
texto.txt:	and what is mine my love shall render him.
texto.txt:	as well possess'd; my love is more than his;
texto.txt:	i am beloved of beauteous hermia:
texto.txt:	made love to nedar's daughter, helena,
texto.txt:	but, being over-full of self-affairs,
texto.txt:	my mind did lose it. but, demetrius, come;
texto.txt:	come, my hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
texto.txt:lysander	how now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
texto.txt:	the course of true love never did run smooth;
texto.txt:hermia	o hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
texto.txt:hermia	if then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
texto.txt:	as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
texto.txt:	wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
texto.txt:	cannot pursue us. if thou lovest me then,
texto.txt:	by the simplicity of venus' doves,
texto.txt:	by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
texto.txt:lysander	keep promise, love. look, here comes helena.
texto.txt:	demetrius loves your fair: o happy fair!
texto.txt:	your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
texto.txt:hermia	i frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
texto.txt:hermia	i give him curses, yet he gives me love.
texto.txt:helena	o that my prayers could such affection move!
texto.txt:helena	the more i love, the more he hateth me.
texto.txt:	o, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
texto.txt:	a time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
texto.txt:	from lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
texto.txt:	love can transpose to form and dignity:
texto.txt:	love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
texto.txt:	nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste;
texto.txt:	and therefore is love said to be a child,
texto.txt:	so the boy love is perjured every where:
texto.txt:bottom	what is pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
texto.txt:quince	a lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
texto.txt:	eyes; i will move storms, i will condole in some
texto.txt:	this is ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
texto.txt:quince	it is the lady that pyramus must love.
texto.txt:	thisne;' 'ah, pyramus, lover dear! thy thisby dear,
texto.txt:	sucking dove; i will roar you an 'twere any
texto.txt:	summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
texto.txt:fairy	     over hill, over dale,
texto.txt:	over park, over pale,
texto.txt:	in those freckles live their savours:
texto.txt:	a lovely boy, stolen from an indian king;
texto.txt:	but she perforce withholds the loved boy,
texto.txt:	crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
texto.txt:	and now they never meet in grove or green,
texto.txt:	playing on pipes of corn and versing love
texto.txt:	your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
texto.txt:	knowing i know thy love to theseus?
texto.txt:	that they have overborne their continents:
texto.txt:	therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
texto.txt:	their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
texto.txt:oberon	well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
texto.txt:	and loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
texto.txt:	it fell upon a little western flower,
texto.txt:	before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
texto.txt:	and maidens call it love-in-idleness.
texto.txt:	fetch me that flower; the herb i shew'd thee once:
texto.txt:	upon the next live creature that it sees.
texto.txt:	she shall pursue it with the soul of love:
texto.txt:	and i will overhear their conference.
texto.txt:demetrius	i love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
texto.txt:	tell you, i do not, nor i cannot love you?
texto.txt:helena	and even for that do i love you the more.
texto.txt:	neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
texto.txt:	what worser place can i beg in your love,--
texto.txt:	into the hands of one that loves you not;
texto.txt:	then how can it be said i am alone,
texto.txt:	the dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
texto.txt:	we cannot fight for love, as men may do;
texto.txt:	to die upon the hand i love so well.
texto.txt:oberon	fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
texto.txt:	thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
texto.txt:	hast thou the flower there? welcome, wanderer.
texto.txt:	quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
texto.txt:	lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
texto.txt:	take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
texto.txt:	a sweet athenian lady is in love
texto.txt:	effect it with some care, that he may prove
texto.txt:	more fond on her than she upon her love:
texto.txt:	philomel, with melody
texto.txt:	come our lovely lady nigh;
texto.txt:	philomel, with melody, &c.
texto.txt:	[enter oberon and squeezes the flower on titania's eyelids]
texto.txt:	do it for thy true-love take,
texto.txt:	love and languish for his sake:
texto.txt:lysander	fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
texto.txt:	love takes the meaning in love's conference.
texto.txt:	but, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
texto.txt:	thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
texto.txt:	on whose eyes i might approve
texto.txt:	this flower's force in stirring love.
texto.txt:	near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
texto.txt:	when thou wakest, let love forbid
texto.txt:demetrius	stay, on thy peril: i alone will go.
texto.txt:	lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
texto.txt:	what though he love your hermia? lord, what though?
texto.txt:	yet hermia still loves you: then be content.
texto.txt:	not hermia but helena i love:
texto.txt:	who will not change a raven for a dove?
texto.txt:	love's stories written in love's richest book.
texto.txt:	and, all my powers, address your love and might
texto.txt:	lysander! what, removed? lysander! lord!
texto.txt:	speak, of all loves! i swoon almost with fear.
texto.txt:bottom	thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--
texto.txt:	most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely jew,
texto.txt:titania	[awaking]  what angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
texto.txt:	and thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
texto.txt:	on the first view to say, to swear, i love thee.
texto.txt:	love keep little company together now-a-days; the
texto.txt:	and i do love thee: therefore, go with me;
texto.txt:	and sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
texto.txt:	to have my love to bed and to arise;
texto.txt:	and when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
texto.txt:	tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.
texto.txt:	what night-rule now about this haunted grove?
texto.txt:puck	my mistress with a monster is in love.
texto.txt:	near to her close and consecrated bower,
texto.txt:	the shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
texto.txt:	titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
texto.txt:	with the love-juice, as i did bid thee do?
texto.txt:oberon	stand close: this is the same athenian.
texto.txt:demetrius	o, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
texto.txt:	and laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
texto.txt:	some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.
texto.txt:	with sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:
texto.txt:oberon	   flower of this purple dye,
texto.txt:	when his love he doth espy,
texto.txt:	pleading for a lover's fee.
texto.txt:	that must needs be sport alone;
texto.txt:	bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
texto.txt:lysander	demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
texto.txt:	to what, my love, shall i compare thine eyne?
texto.txt:	you both are rivals, and love hermia;
texto.txt:	for you love hermia; this you know i know:
texto.txt:	in hermia's love i yield you up my part;
texto.txt:	whom i do love and will do till my death.
texto.txt:	if e'er i loved her, all that love is gone.
texto.txt:	look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
texto.txt:lysander	why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?
texto.txt:hermia	what love could press lysander from my side?
texto.txt:lysander	lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
texto.txt:	have with our needles created both one flower,
texto.txt:	two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
texto.txt:	and will you rent our ancient love asunder,
texto.txt:	though i alone do feel the injury.
texto.txt:	and made your other love, demetrius,
texto.txt:	deny your love, so rich within his soul,
texto.txt:	so hung upon with love, so fortunate,
texto.txt:	but miserable most, to love unloved?
texto.txt:	my love, my life my soul, fair helena!
texto.txt:	helen, i love thee; by my life, i do:
texto.txt:	i swear by that which i will lose for thee,
texto.txt:	to prove him false that says i love thee not.
texto.txt:demetrius	i say i love thee more than he can do.
texto.txt:lysander	if thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
texto.txt:	sweet love,--
texto.txt:lysander	thy love! out, tawny tartar, out!
texto.txt:	hate me! wherefore? o me! what news, my love!
texto.txt:	since night you loved me; yet since night you left
texto.txt:	that i do hate thee and love helena.
texto.txt:	you thief of love! what, have you come by night
texto.txt:	and stolen my love's heart from him?
texto.txt:	because she is something lower than myself,
texto.txt:hermia	lower! hark, again.
texto.txt:	i evermore did love you, hermia,
texto.txt:	save that, in love unto demetrius,
texto.txt:	he follow'd you; for love i follow'd him;
texto.txt:	let her alone: speak not of helena;
texto.txt:	never so little show of love to her,
texto.txt:	and so far blameless proves my enterprise,
texto.txt:oberon	thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
texto.txt:	hie therefore, robin, overcast the night;
texto.txt:	the starry welkin cover thou anon
texto.txt:	and back to athens shall the lovers wend,
texto.txt:	i with the morning's love have oft made sport,
texto.txt:	and, like a forester, the groves may tread,
texto.txt:	gentle lover, remedy.
texto.txt:	and the country proverb known,
texto.txt:titania	come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
texto.txt:	i would be loath to have you overflown with a
texto.txt:	my sweet love?
texto.txt:titania	or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
texto.txt:bottom	truly, a peck of provender: i could munch your good
texto.txt:	o, how i love thee! how i dote on thee!
texto.txt:	with a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
texto.txt:	stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
texto.txt:	dian's bud o'er cupid's flower
texto.txt:oberon	there lies your love.
texto.txt:	there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
texto.txt:	we the globe can compass soon,
texto.txt:	my love shall hear the music of my hounds.
texto.txt:	such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
texto.txt:	but by some power it is,--my love to hermia,
texto.txt:	now i do wish it, love it, long for it,
texto.txt:theseus	fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
texto.txt:	egeus, i will overbear your will;
texto.txt:	lovers speak of.
texto.txt:	lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
texto.txt:	the lunatic, the lover and the poet
texto.txt:	that is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
texto.txt:hippolyta	but all the story of the night told over,
texto.txt:theseus	here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
texto.txt:	joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
texto.txt:	we'll none of that: that have i told my love,
texto.txt:	and his love thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
texto.txt:	it is not for you: i have heard it over,
texto.txt:hippolyta	i love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
texto.txt:	love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
texto.txt:	on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.
texto.txt:	wall, that vile wall which did these lovers sunder;
texto.txt:	by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
texto.txt:	let lion, moonshine, wall, and lovers twain
texto.txt:	through which the lovers, pyramus and thisby,
texto.txt:	through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
texto.txt:	and thou, o wall, o sweet, o lovely wall,
texto.txt:	thou wall, o wall, o sweet and lovely wall,
texto.txt:	thanks, courteous wall: jove shield thee well for this!
texto.txt:thisbe	my love thou art, my love i think.
texto.txt:pyramus	think what thou wilt, i am thy lover's grace;
texto.txt:thisbe	this is old ninny's tomb. where is my love?
texto.txt:	since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
texto.txt:	that lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd
texto.txt:	tongue, lose thy light;
texto.txt:theseus	with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
texto.txt:	prove an ass.
texto.txt:	back and finds her lover?
texto.txt:thisbe	          asleep, my love?
texto.txt:	what, dead, my dove?
texto.txt:	must cover thy sweet eyes.
texto.txt:	lovers, make moan:
texto.txt:	epilogue alone.
texto.txt:	lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
texto.txt:	as much as we this night have overwatch'd.
texto.txt:	ever true in loving be;
texto.txt:claudio	a young lord of florence.
texto.txt:leonato	governor of messina.
texto.txt:	|  followers of don john.
texto.txt:	bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio.
texto.txt:messenger	i have already delivered him letters, and there
texto.txt:leonato	a kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
texto.txt:	now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
texto.txt:	am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and i
texto.txt:	heart; for, truly, i love none.
texto.txt:	swear he loves me.
texto.txt:don pedro	what secret hath held you here, that you followed
texto.txt:	in love. with who? now that is your grace's part.
texto.txt:don pedro	amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
texto.txt:claudio	that i love her, i feel.
texto.txt:benedick	that i neither feel how she should be loved nor
texto.txt:	i may go the finer, i will live a bachelor.
texto.txt:don pedro	i shall see thee, ere i die, look pale with love.
texto.txt:	not with love: prove that ever i lose more blood
texto.txt:	with love than i will get again with drinking, pick
texto.txt:	wilt prove a notable argument.
texto.txt:don pedro	the sixth of july: your loving friend, benedick.
texto.txt:don pedro	my love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
texto.txt:	than to drive liking to the name of love:
texto.txt:don pedro	thou wilt be like a lover presently
texto.txt:	if thou dost love fair hero, cherish it,
texto.txt:claudio	how sweetly you do minister to love,
texto.txt:	that know love's grief by his complexion!
texto.txt:	look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
texto.txt:	cover; they show well outward. the prince and count
texto.txt:	orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
texto.txt:	the prince discovered to claudio that he loved my
texto.txt:	love from any: in this, though i cannot be said to
texto.txt:don john	come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to
texto.txt:	glory of my overthrow: if i can cross him any way, i
texto.txt:	my mind! shall we go prove what's to be done?
texto.txt:	heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
texto.txt:	there live we as merry as the day is long.
texto.txt:	overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
texto.txt:don pedro	my visor is philemon's roof; within the house is jove.
texto.txt:don pedro	speak low, if you speak love.
texto.txt:balthasar	i love you the better: the hearers may cry, amen.
texto.txt:don john	signior, you are very near my brother in his love:
texto.txt:claudio	how know you he loves her?
texto.txt:	save in the office and affairs of love:
texto.txt:	therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
texto.txt:	overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
texto.txt:	she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
texto.txt:benedick	o god, sir, here's a dish i love not: i cannot
texto.txt:	should prove the mother of fools. i have brought
texto.txt:claudio	to-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love
texto.txt:	strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. i
texto.txt:	shall fall in love with benedick; and i, with your
texto.txt:	shall fall in love with beatrice. if we can do this,
texto.txt:	ours, for we are the only love-gods. go in with me,
texto.txt:borachio	not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no
texto.txt:	the count claudio alone: tell them that you know
texto.txt:	that hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
texto.txt:	prince and claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
texto.txt:	semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
texto.txt:	assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
texto.txt:	behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
texto.txt:	of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
texto.txt:	be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
texto.txt:	monsieur love! i will hide me in the arbour.
texto.txt:	yet will he swear he loves.
texto.txt:	to-day, that your niece beatrice was in love with
texto.txt:	never think that lady would have loved any man.
texto.txt:	of it but that she loves him with an enraged
texto.txt:	discovers it.
texto.txt:	with scorn, write to him that i love him?'
texto.txt:leonato	o, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she
texto.txt:	love him, i should.'
texto.txt:	ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
texto.txt:	other, if she will not discover it.
texto.txt:don pedro	in every thing but in loving benedick.
texto.txt:	will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
texto.txt:	she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
texto.txt:	love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the
texto.txt:	we go seek benedick, and tell him of her love?
texto.txt:	let it cool the while. i love benedick well; and i
texto.txt:	seems her affections have their full bent. love me!
texto.txt:	the love come from her; they say too that she will
texto.txt:	so, i cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
texto.txt:	horribly in love with her. i may chance have some
texto.txt:	doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
texto.txt:	die a bachelor, i did not think i should live till i
texto.txt:	she's a fair lady: i do spy some marks of love in

texto.txt:	is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
texto.txt:	bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
texto.txt:	is sick in love with beatrice. of this matter
texto.txt:	close by the ground, to hear our conference.
texto.txt:	is couched in the woodbine coverture.
texto.txt:hero	then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
texto.txt:	that benedick loves beatrice so entirely?
texto.txt:	but i persuaded them, if they loved benedick,
texto.txt:hero	o god of love! i know he doth deserve
texto.txt:	all matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
texto.txt:	she knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
texto.txt:	if silent, why, a block moved with none.
texto.txt:	therefore let benedick, like cover'd fire,
texto.txt:hero	if it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
texto.txt:	no glory lives behind the back of such.
texto.txt:	and, benedick, love on; i will requite thee,
texto.txt:	taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
texto.txt:	if thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
texto.txt:	to bind our loves up in a holy band;
texto.txt:claudio	i hope he be in love.
texto.txt:	him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
texto.txt:claudio	yet say i, he is in love.
texto.txt:claudio	if he be not in love with some woman, there is no
texto.txt:claudio	that's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.
texto.txt:	a lute-string and now governed by stops.
texto.txt:	conclude he is in love.
texto.txt:claudio	nay, but i know who loves him.
texto.txt:claudio	if there be any impediment, i pray you discover it.
texto.txt:don john	you may think i love you not: let that appear
texto.txt:	before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
texto.txt:dogberry	why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
texto.txt:borachio	stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for
texto.txt:watchman	[aside]  some treason, masters: yet stand close.
texto.txt:	recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
texto.txt:borachio	we are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken
texto.txt:margaret	clap's into 'light o' love;' that goes without a
texto.txt:beatrice	ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
texto.txt:hero	these gloves the count sent me; they are an
texto.txt:	that i think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, i am
texto.txt:	are in love or that you will be in love or that you
texto.txt:	can be in love. yet benedick was such another, and
texto.txt:	can cunning sin cover itself withal!
texto.txt:	not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.
texto.txt:	bashful sincerity and comely love.
texto.txt:claudio	let me but move one question to your daughter;
texto.txt:	i am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
texto.txt:	for thee i'll lock up all the gates of love,
texto.txt:	death is the fairest cover for her shame
texto.txt:	do not live, hero; do not ope thine eyes:
texto.txt:	why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
texto.txt:	but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised
texto.txt:	who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
texto.txt:	why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
texto.txt:	if i know more of any man alive
texto.txt:	prove you that any man with me conversed
texto.txt:	the practise of it lives in john the bastard,
texto.txt:	and every lovely organ of her life
texto.txt:	than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
texto.txt:	if ever love had interest in his liver,
texto.txt:	but if all aim but this be levell'd false,
texto.txt:	and though you know my inwardness and love
texto.txt:	come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
texto.txt:benedick	i do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
texto.txt:	possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as
texto.txt:benedick	by my sword, beatrice, thou lovest me.
texto.txt:benedick	i will swear by it that you love me; and i will make
texto.txt:	him eat it that says i love not you.
texto.txt:	i love thee.
texto.txt:	protest i loved you.
texto.txt:beatrice	i love you with so much of my heart that none is
texto.txt:beatrice	i am gone, though i am here: there is no love in
texto.txt:beatrice	is he not approved in the height a villain, that
texto.txt:	accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
texto.txt:benedick	tarry, good beatrice. by this hand, i love thee.
texto.txt:beatrice	use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
texto.txt:	before such villains! masters, it is proved already
texto.txt:	piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
texto.txt:	bring me a father that so loved his child,
texto.txt:	whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
texto.txt:	patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
texto.txt:	i'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
texto.txt:antonio	content yourself. god knows i loved my niece;
texto.txt:	did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:
texto.txt:claudio	all, all; and, moreover, god saw him when he was
texto.txt:	the love of beatrice.
texto.txt:	moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,
texto.txt:	could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
texto.txt:	to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
texto.txt:	i had rather seal with my death than repeat over
texto.txt:	in the rare semblance that i loved it first.
texto.txt:leonato	art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
texto.txt:borachio	yea, even i alone.
texto.txt:leonato	i cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
texto.txt:	how innocent she died; and if your love
texto.txt:	and she alone is heir to both of us:
texto.txt:	your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
texto.txt:dogberry	moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and
texto.txt:	shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou
texto.txt:margaret	to have no man come over me! why, shall i always
texto.txt:	the god of love,
texto.txt:	that sits above,
texto.txt:	i mean in singing; but in loving, leander the good
texto.txt:	swimmer, troilus the first employer of panders, and
texto.txt:	over and over as my poor self in love. marry, i
texto.txt:	which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
texto.txt:	good parts did you first suffer love for me?
texto.txt:benedick	suffer love! a good epithet! i do suffer love
texto.txt:	indeed, for i love thee against my will.
texto.txt:	yours; for i will never love that which my friend hates.
texto.txt:benedick	an old, an old instance, beatrice, that lived in
texto.txt:	in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
texto.txt:benedick	serve god, love me and mend. there will i leave
texto.txt:	coil at home: it is proved my lady hero hath been
texto.txt:benedick	i will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
texto.txt:	buried in thy eyes; and moreover i will go with
texto.txt:	lives in death with glorious fame.
texto.txt:benedick	and i do with an eye of love requite her.

texto.txt:where their dear governess and lady lies,
texto.txt:this moves in him more rage and lesser pity,
texto.txt:shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:
texto.txt:that done, some worthless slave of thine i'll slay,
texto.txt:she conjures him by high almighty jove,
texto.txt:by her untimely tears, her husband's love,
texto.txt:if ever man were moved with woman moans,
texto.txt:be moved with my tears, my sighs, my groans:
texto.txt:for kings like gods should govern everything.
texto.txt:'this deed will make thee only loved for fear;
texto.txt:but happy monarchs still are fear'd for love:
texto.txt:when they in thee the like offences prove:
texto.txt:if but for fear of this, thy will remove;
texto.txt:to their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls' haste
texto.txt:'thou art,' quoth she, 'a sea, a sovereign king;
texto.txt:black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,
texto.txt:'so shall these slaves be king, and thou their slave;

texto.txt:and he hath won what he would lose again:
texto.txt:devours his will, that lived by foul devouring.
texto.txt:some purer chest to close so pure a mind.
texto.txt:with close-tongued treason and the ravisher!
texto.txt:but i alone alone must sit and pine,
texto.txt:for collatine's dear love be kept unspotted:
texto.txt:unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers;
texto.txt:eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
texto.txt:to slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,
texto.txt:and let mild women to him lose their mildness,
texto.txt:let him have time to live a loathed slave,
texto.txt:and time to see one that by alms doth live
texto.txt:as slanderous death's-man to so base a slave?
texto.txt:for if i die, my honour lives in thee;
texto.txt:but if i live, thou livest in my defame:
texto.txt:'in vain,' quoth she, 'i live, and seek in vain
texto.txt:'o, that is gone for which i sought to live,

texto.txt:make thy sad grove in my dishevell'd hair:
texto.txt:since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds.'
texto.txt:to live or die which of the twain were better,
texto.txt:they that lose half with greater patience bear it
texto.txt:whose love of either to myself was nearer,
texto.txt:the one will live, the other being dead:
texto.txt:my resolution, love, shall be thy boast,
texto.txt:and all my fame that lives disbursed be
texto.txt:to those that live, and think no shame of me.

texto.txt:a letter to my lord, my love, my dear;
texto.txt:first hovering o'er the paper with her quill:
texto.txt:if ever, love, thy lucrece thou wilt see--
texto.txt:she dares not thereof make discovery,
texto.txt:to see sad sights moves more than hear them told;
texto.txt:the post attends, and she delivers it,
texto.txt:show'd deep regard and smiling government.
texto.txt:let sin, alone committed, light alone
texto.txt:and one man's lust these many lives confounds:
texto.txt:those round clear pearls of his, that move thy pity,
texto.txt:which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought,
texto.txt:her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares.
texto.txt:sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?
texto.txt:and entertain my love; else lasting shame
texto.txt:if thou my love's desire do contradict.
texto.txt:i should not live to speak another word;
texto.txt:doth in her poison'd closet yet endure.'
texto.txt:where shall i live now lucrece is unlived?
texto.txt:and leave the faltering feeble souls alive?
texto.txt:then live, sweet lucrece, live again and see
texto.txt:and live to be revenged on her death.
texto.txt:	a pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
texto.txt:	whole misadventured piteous overthrows
texto.txt:	the fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
texto.txt:	which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
texto.txt:gregory	ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
texto.txt:sampson	i strike quickly, being moved.
texto.txt:gregory	but thou art not quickly moved to strike.
texto.txt:sampson	a dog of the house of montague moves me.
texto.txt:gregory	to move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
texto.txt:	therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
texto.txt:sampson	a dog of that house shall move me to stand: i will
texto.txt:gregory	that shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
texto.txt:	and hear the sentence of your moved prince.
texto.txt:	your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
texto.txt:	and yours, close fighting ere i did approach:
texto.txt:	where, underneath the grove of sycamore
texto.txt:	and stole into the covert of the wood:
texto.txt:	that most are busied when they're most alone,
texto.txt:	black and portentous must this humour prove,
texto.txt:	unless good counsel may the cause remove.
texto.txt:	but to himself so secret and so close,
texto.txt:	so far from sounding and discovery,
texto.txt:benvolio	in love?
texto.txt:benvolio	of love?
texto.txt:romeo	out of her favour, where i am in love.
texto.txt:benvolio	alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
texto.txt:romeo	alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
texto.txt:	here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
texto.txt:	why, then, o brawling love! o loving hate!
texto.txt:	this love feel i, that feel no love in this.
texto.txt:romeo	why, such is love's transgression.
texto.txt:	with more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
texto.txt:	love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
texto.txt:	being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
texto.txt:	being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
texto.txt:benvolio	tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
texto.txt:	in sadness, cousin, i do love a woman.
texto.txt:benvolio	i aim'd so near, when i supposed you loved.
texto.txt:romeo	a right good mark-man! and she's fair i love.
texto.txt:	from love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
texto.txt:	she will not stay the siege of loving terms,
texto.txt:benvolio	then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
texto.txt:	she hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
texto.txt:	do i live dead that live to tell it now.
texto.txt:	and pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
texto.txt:	such as i love; and you, among the store,
texto.txt:	widow of vitravio; signior placentio and his lovely
texto.txt:	tybalt, lucio and the lively helena.' a fair
texto.txt:	sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lovest,
texto.txt:	one fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
texto.txt:	your lady's love against some other maid
texto.txt:	'tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
texto.txt:	sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
texto.txt:	shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, i trow,
texto.txt:	and since that time it is eleven years;
texto.txt:	for then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
texto.txt:	i warrant, an i should live a thousand years,
texto.txt:	an i might live to see thee married once,
texto.txt:	the valiant paris seeks you for his love.
texto.txt:lady capulet	verona's summer hath not such a flower.
texto.txt:nurse	nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
texto.txt:lady capulet	what say you? can you love the gentleman?
texto.txt:	this precious book of love, this unbound lover,
texto.txt:	to beautify him, only lacks a cover:
texto.txt:	the fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
texto.txt:lady capulet	speak briefly, can you like of paris' love?
texto.txt:juliet	i'll look to like, if looking liking move:
texto.txt:	so stakes me to the ground i cannot move.
texto.txt:mercutio	you are a lover; borrow cupid's wings,
texto.txt:	and soar with them above a common bound.
texto.txt:	i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
texto.txt:	under love's heavy burden do i sink.
texto.txt:mercutio	and, to sink in it, should you burden love;
texto.txt:romeo	is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
texto.txt:mercutio	if love be rough with you, be rough with love;
texto.txt:	prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
texto.txt:	for i am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
texto.txt:	of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
texto.txt:	the cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
texto.txt:	through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
texto.txt:	of a despised life closed in my breast
texto.txt:first servant	away with the joint-stools, remove the
texto.txt:	me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
texto.txt:	brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
texto.txt:	so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
texto.txt:	did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
texto.txt:	fetch me my rapier, boy. what dares the slave
texto.txt:	come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
texto.txt:capulet	content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
texto.txt:	to be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
texto.txt:juliet	saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
texto.txt:romeo	then move not, while my prayer's effect i take.
texto.txt:juliet	my only love sprung from my only hate!
texto.txt:	prodigious birth of love it is to me,
texto.txt:	that i must love a loathed enemy.
texto.txt:	that fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
texto.txt:	now romeo is beloved and loves again,
texto.txt:	and she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
texto.txt:	to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
texto.txt:	and she as much in love, her means much less
texto.txt:	to meet her new-beloved any where:
texto.txt:	romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
texto.txt:	cry but 'ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
texto.txt:	when king cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
texto.txt:	he heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
texto.txt:	blind is his love and best befits the dark.
texto.txt:mercutio	if love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
texto.txt:	as maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
texto.txt:	[juliet appears above at a window]
texto.txt:	her vestal livery is but sick and green
texto.txt:	it is my lady, o, it is my love!
texto.txt:	o, that i were a glove upon that hand,
texto.txt:	or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
texto.txt:	call me but love, and i'll be new baptized;
texto.txt:romeo	with love's light wings did i o'er-perch these walls;
texto.txt:	for stony limits cannot hold love out,
texto.txt:	and what love can do that dares love attempt;
texto.txt:	and but thou love me, let them find me here:
texto.txt:	than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
texto.txt:romeo	by love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
texto.txt:	dost thou love me? i know thou wilt say 'ay,'
texto.txt:	thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
texto.txt:	then say, jove laughs. o gentle romeo,
texto.txt:	if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
texto.txt:	but trust me, gentleman, i'll prove more true
texto.txt:	but that thou overheard'st, ere i was ware,
texto.txt:	my true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
texto.txt:	and not impute this yielding to light love,
texto.txt:	which the dark night hath so discovered.
texto.txt:	lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
texto.txt:romeo	if my heart's dear love--
texto.txt:	this bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
texto.txt:	may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
texto.txt:romeo	the exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
texto.txt:romeo	wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
texto.txt:	my love as deep; the more i give to thee,
texto.txt:	i hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
texto.txt:	[exit, above]
texto.txt:	[re-enter juliet, above]
texto.txt:	if that thy bent of love be honourable,
texto.txt:	[exit, above]
texto.txt:	love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
texto.txt:	but love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
texto.txt:	[re-enter juliet, above]
texto.txt:	how silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
texto.txt:	remembering how i love thy company.
texto.txt:	so loving-jealous of his liberty.
texto.txt:	[exit above]
texto.txt:	with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
texto.txt:	for nought so vile that on the earth doth live
texto.txt:	within the infant rind of this small flower
texto.txt:romeo	then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
texto.txt:	is rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
texto.txt:	so soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
texto.txt:	to season love, that of it doth not taste!
texto.txt:romeo	thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline.
texto.txt:friar laurence	for doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
texto.txt:romeo	and bad'st me bury love.
texto.txt:romeo	i pray thee, chide not; she whom i love now
texto.txt:	doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
texto.txt:	thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
texto.txt:	for this alliance may so happy prove,
texto.txt:	to turn your households' rancour to pure love.
texto.txt:	love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
texto.txt:	that petrarch flowed in: laura to his lady was but a
texto.txt:	kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
texto.txt:romeo	pink for flower.
texto.txt:romeo	why, then is my pump well flowered.
texto.txt:	to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
texto.txt:mercutio	why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
texto.txt:	for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
texto.txt:romeo	a gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
texto.txt:	o, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
texto.txt:	driving back shadows over louring hills:
texto.txt:	therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
texto.txt:	my words would bandy her to my sweet love,
texto.txt:	past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
texto.txt:	sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
texto.txt:nurse	your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
texto.txt:	'your love says, like an honest gentleman,
texto.txt:	to fetch a ladder, by the which your love
texto.txt:	do thou but close our hands with holy words,
texto.txt:	then love-devouring death do what he dare;
texto.txt:	therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
texto.txt:	a lover may bestride the gossamer
texto.txt:	but my true love is grown to such excess
texto.txt:	for, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
texto.txt:	any in italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
texto.txt:	soon moody to be moved.
texto.txt:tybalt	follow me close, for i will speak to them.
texto.txt:mercutio	but i'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
texto.txt:	marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
texto.txt:romeo	tybalt, the reason that i have to love thee
texto.txt:	but love thee better than thou canst devise,
texto.txt:	till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
texto.txt:	lives; that i mean to make bold withal, and as you
texto.txt:	with his followers]
texto.txt:romeo	alive, in triumph! and mercutio slain!
texto.txt:	is but a little way above our heads,
texto.txt:benvolio	o noble prince, i can discover all
texto.txt:	romeo slew tybalt, romeo must not live.
texto.txt:	spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
texto.txt:	lovers can see to do their amorous rites
texto.txt:	by their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
texto.txt:	and learn me how to lose a winning match,
texto.txt:	with thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
texto.txt:	think true love acted simple modesty.
texto.txt:	come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
texto.txt:	that all the world will be in love with night
texto.txt:	o, i have bought the mansion of a love,
texto.txt:	that ever i should live to see thee dead!
texto.txt:	my dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
texto.txt:juliet	o serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
texto.txt:	dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
texto.txt:	my husband lives, that tybalt would have slain;
texto.txt:	which modern lamentations might have moved?
texto.txt:nurse	weeping and wailing over tybalt's corse:
texto.txt:	where juliet lives; and every cat and dog
texto.txt:	live here in heaven and may look on her;
texto.txt:	more honourable state, more courtship lives
texto.txt:	wert thou as young as i, juliet thy love,
texto.txt:	with blood removed but little from her own?
texto.txt:	my conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
texto.txt:	shot from the deadly level of a gun,
texto.txt:	and stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
texto.txt:	in thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
texto.txt:	fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
texto.txt:	which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
texto.txt:	thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
texto.txt:	killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
texto.txt:	thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
texto.txt:	what, rouse thee, man! thy juliet is alive,
texto.txt:	thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
texto.txt:	go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
texto.txt:	where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
texto.txt:	that we have had no time to move our daughter:
texto.txt:	look you, she loved her kinsman tybalt dearly,
texto.txt:	of my child's love: i think she will be ruled
texto.txt:	acquaint her here of my son paris' love;
texto.txt:	[enter romeo and juliet above, at the window]
texto.txt:	believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
texto.txt:	no nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
texto.txt:	i must be gone and live, or stay and die.
texto.txt:	the vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
texto.txt:juliet	art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
texto.txt:	that may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
texto.txt:romeo	and trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
texto.txt:	an if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
texto.txt:	therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
texto.txt:	as that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
texto.txt:lady capulet	that is, because the traitor murderer lives.
texto.txt:	where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
texto.txt:	to wreak the love i bore my cousin
texto.txt:	without a sudden calm, will overset
texto.txt:	have you deliver'd to her our decree?
texto.txt:	but thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
texto.txt:	alone, in company, still my care hath been
texto.txt:	to answer 'i'll not wed; i cannot love,

texto.txt:	and therefore have i little talk'd of love;
texto.txt:	which, too much minded by herself alone,

texto.txt:paris	do not deny to him that you love me.
texto.txt:juliet	i will confess to you that i love him.

texto.txt:warwick	indeed i think the young king loves you not.

texto.txt:	till you do live to see a son of mine

texto.txt:	and welcome merry shrove-tide.
texto.txt:	and a merry heart lives long-a.

texto.txt:	you have but eleven now. come, i charge you both go

texto.txt:pistol	my knight, i will inflame thy noble liver,
texto.txt:falstaff	i will deliver her.
texto.txt:falstaff	my king! my jove! i speak to thee, my heart!
texto.txt:	he hath intent his wonted followers
texto.txt:	should say will, i doubt, prove mine own marring.
texto.txt:	ill venture it come unluckily home, i break, and
texto.txt:	you, my gentle creditors, lose. here i promised you
texto.txt:	much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will
texto.txt:thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
texto.txt:of his self-love, to stop posterity?
texto.txt:calls back the lovely april of her prime:
texto.txt:  but if thou live, remember'd not to be,
texto.txt:unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
texto.txt:so great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
texto.txt:for having traffic with thyself alone,
texto.txt:  which, used, lives th' executor to be.
texto.txt:the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
texto.txt:  but flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,
texto.txt:  leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
texto.txt:why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,
texto.txt:  sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'
texto.txt:  no love toward others in that bosom sits
texto.txt:for shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
texto.txt:grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
texto.txt:but that thou none lovest is most evident;
texto.txt:shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
texto.txt:or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
texto.txt:  make thee another self, for love of me,
texto.txt:  that beauty still may live in thine or thee.
texto.txt:herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
texto.txt:o, that you were yourself! but, love, you are
texto.txt:no longer yours than you yourself here live:
texto.txt:  o, none but unthrifts! dear my love, you know
texto.txt:  and all in war with time for love of you,
texto.txt:with virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
texto.txt:can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
texto.txt:  and you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.
texto.txt:  but were some child of yours alive that time,
texto.txt:  you should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
texto.txt:thou art more lovely and more temperate:
texto.txt:nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
texto.txt:  so long lives this and this gives life to thee.
texto.txt:and burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
texto.txt:o, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
texto.txt:  my love shall in my verse ever live young.
texto.txt:  mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
texto.txt:with april's first-born flowers, and all things rare
texto.txt:o' let me, true in love, but truly write,
texto.txt:and then believe me, my love is as fair
texto.txt:for all that beauty that doth cover thee
texto.txt:which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
texto.txt:o, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
texto.txt:the perfect ceremony of love's rite,
texto.txt:and in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
texto.txt:o'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.
texto.txt:who plead for love and look for recompense
texto.txt:  o, learn to read what silent love hath writ:
texto.txt:  to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
texto.txt:  then happy i, that love and am beloved
texto.txt:  where i may not remove nor be removed.
texto.txt:lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
texto.txt:and puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
texto.txt:  then may i dare to boast how i do love thee;
texto.txt:  till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
texto.txt:i all alone beweep my outcast state
texto.txt:  for thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
texto.txt:and weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
texto.txt:and there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
texto.txt:hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
texto.txt:but things removed that hidden in thee lie!
texto.txt:thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
texto.txt:hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
texto.txt:that due of many now is thine alone:
texto.txt:  their images i loved i view in thee,
texto.txt:when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover,
texto.txt:these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
texto.txt:reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
texto.txt:o, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
texto.txt:a dearer birth than this his love had brought,
texto.txt:  but since he died and poets better prove,
texto.txt:  theirs for their style i'll read, his for his love.'
texto.txt:flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
texto.txt:  yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
texto.txt:  ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
texto.txt:and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
texto.txt:such civil war is in my love and hate
texto.txt:although our undivided loves are one:
texto.txt:without thy help by me be borne alone.
texto.txt:in our two loves there is but one respect,
texto.txt:though in our lives a separable spite,
texto.txt:which though it alter not love's sole effect,
texto.txt:yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
texto.txt:  but do not so; i love thee in such sort
texto.txt:i make my love engrafted to this store:
texto.txt:and by a part of all thy glory live.
texto.txt:eternal numbers to outlive long date.
texto.txt:even for this let us divided live,
texto.txt:and our dear love lose name of single one,
texto.txt:that due to thee which thou deservest alone.
texto.txt:o absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,
texto.txt:to entertain the time with thoughts of love,
texto.txt:take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;
texto.txt:no love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
texto.txt:then if for my love thou my love receivest,
texto.txt:i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
texto.txt:although thou steal thee all my poverty;
texto.txt:and yet, love knows, it is a greater grief
texto.txt:to bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.
texto.txt:and yet it may be said i loved her dearly;
texto.txt:a loss in love that touches me more nearly.
texto.txt:loving offenders, thus i will excuse ye:
texto.txt:thou dost love her, because thou knowst i love her;
texto.txt:suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
texto.txt:if i lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
texto.txt:both find each other, and i lose both twain,
texto.txt:  sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.
texto.txt:upon the farthest earth removed from thee;
texto.txt:in tender embassy of love to thee,
texto.txt:my life, being made of four, with two alone
texto.txt:a closet never pierced with crystal eyes--
texto.txt:  and my heart's right thy inward love of heart.
texto.txt:or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
texto.txt:with my love's picture then my eye doth feast
texto.txt:and in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
texto.txt:so, either by thy picture or my love,
texto.txt:for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
texto.txt:  for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
texto.txt:when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
texto.txt:when love, converted from the thing it was,
texto.txt:  since why to love i can allege no cause.
texto.txt:his rider loved not speed, being made from thee:
texto.txt:thus can my love excuse the slow offence
texto.txt:therefore desire of perfect'st love being made,
texto.txt:but love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;
texto.txt:for that sweet odour which doth in it live.
texto.txt:when summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
texto.txt:they live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,
texto.txt:  and so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
texto.txt:of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
texto.txt:when wasteful war shall statues overturn,
texto.txt:  you live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes.
texto.txt:sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
texto.txt:so, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill
texto.txt:the spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.
texto.txt:return of love, more blest may be the view;
texto.txt:being your slave, what should i do but tend
texto.txt:whilst i, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
texto.txt:but, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
texto.txt:  so true a fool is love that in your will,
texto.txt:that god forbid that made me first your slave,
texto.txt:o, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
texto.txt:it is my love that keeps mine eye awake;
texto.txt:mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
texto.txt:sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
texto.txt:mine own self-love quite contrary i read;
texto.txt:self so self-loving were iniquity.
texto.txt:against my love shall be, as i am now,
texto.txt:my sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
texto.txt:  and they shall live, and he in them still green.
texto.txt:and brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
texto.txt:that time will come and take my love away.
texto.txt:  but weep to have that which it fears to lose.
texto.txt:whose action is no stronger than a flower?
texto.txt:  that in black ink my love may still shine bright.
texto.txt:  save that, to die, i leave my love alone.
texto.txt:ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
texto.txt:why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,
texto.txt:beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
texto.txt:and, proud of many, lives upon his gains.
texto.txt:when beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
texto.txt:to live a second life on second head;
texto.txt:to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
texto.txt:so thou be good, slander doth but approve
texto.txt:for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
texto.txt:  then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
texto.txt:the hand that writ it; for i love you so
texto.txt:but let your love even with my life decay,
texto.txt:what merit lived in me, that you should love
texto.txt:after my death, dear love, forget me quite,
texto.txt:for you in me can nothing worthy prove;
texto.txt:o, lest your true love may seem false in this,
texto.txt:that you for love speak well of me untrue,
texto.txt:and live no more to shame nor me nor you.
texto.txt:  and so should you, to love things nothing worth.
texto.txt:  this thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,
texto.txt:  to love that well which thou must leave ere long.
texto.txt:now counting best to be with you alone,
texto.txt:o, know, sweet love, i always write of you,
texto.txt:and you and love are still my argument;
texto.txt:  so is my love still telling what is told.
texto.txt:those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
texto.txt:whilst i alone did call upon thy aid,
texto.txt:my verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
texto.txt:i grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
texto.txt:no praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
texto.txt:your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
texto.txt:  the worst was this; my love was my decay.
texto.txt:or i shall live your epitaph to make,
texto.txt:  you still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--
texto.txt:and do so, love; yet when they have devised
texto.txt:  there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
texto.txt:than this rich praise, that you alone are you?
texto.txt:but that is in my thought, whose love to you,
texto.txt:above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
texto.txt:and prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
texto.txt:for bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
texto.txt:  such is my love, to thee i so belong,
texto.txt:thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,
texto.txt:thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
texto.txt:  for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
texto.txt:to linger out a purposed overthrow.
texto.txt:wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
texto.txt:thy love is better than high birth to me,
texto.txt:  wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
texto.txt:and life no longer than thy love will stay,
texto.txt:for it depends upon that love of thine.
texto.txt:happy to have thy love, happy to die!
texto.txt:so shall i live, supposing thou art true,
texto.txt:like a deceived husband; so love's face
texto.txt:may still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
texto.txt:for there can live no hatred in thine eye,
texto.txt:that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
texto.txt:unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,
texto.txt:the summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
texto.txt:though to itself it only live and die,
texto.txt:but if that flower with base infection meet,
texto.txt:how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
texto.txt:o, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
texto.txt:where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
texto.txt:  the hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
texto.txt:both grace and faults are loved of more and less;
texto.txt:  but do not so; i love thee in such sort
texto.txt:and yet this time removed was summer's time,
texto.txt:of different flowers in odour and in hue
texto.txt:if not from my love's breath? the purple pride
texto.txt:in my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
texto.txt:  more flowers i noted, yet i none could see
texto.txt:rise, resty muse, my love's sweet face survey,
texto.txt:  give my love fame faster than time wastes life;
texto.txt:both truth and beauty on my love depends;
texto.txt:to make him much outlive a gilded tomb,
texto.txt:my love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
texto.txt:i love not less, though less the show appear:
texto.txt:that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
texto.txt:our love was new and then but in the spring
texto.txt:as philomel in summer's front doth sing
texto.txt:and sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
texto.txt:alack, what poverty my muse brings forth,
texto.txt:that over-goes my blunt invention quite,
texto.txt:let not my love be call'd idolatry,
texto.txt:nor my beloved as an idol show,
texto.txt:kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
texto.txt:  'fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,
texto.txt:in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
texto.txt:can yet the lease of my true love control,
texto.txt:and peace proclaims olives of endless age.
texto.txt:my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
texto.txt:since, spite of him, i'll live in this poor rhyme,
texto.txt:that may express my love or thy dear merit?
texto.txt:so that eternal love in love's fresh case
texto.txt:  finding the first conceit of love there bred
texto.txt:that is my home of love: if i have ranged,
texto.txt:askance and strangely: but, by all above,
texto.txt:and worse essays proved thee my best of love.
texto.txt:a god in love, to whom i am confined.
texto.txt:  even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
texto.txt:your love and pity doth the impression fill
texto.txt:none else to me, nor i to none alive,
texto.txt:and that which governs me to go about
texto.txt:for it no form delivers to the heart
texto.txt:of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:
texto.txt:the crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature:
texto.txt:and that your love taught it this alchemy,
texto.txt:  that mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
texto.txt:even those that said i could not love you dearer:
texto.txt:might i not then say 'now i love you best,'
texto.txt:  love is a babe; then might i not say so,
texto.txt:admit impediments. love is not love
texto.txt:or bends with the remover to remove:
texto.txt:love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
texto.txt:love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
texto.txt:  if this be error and upon me proved,
texto.txt:  i never writ, nor no man ever loved.
texto.txt:forgot upon your dearest love to call,
texto.txt:bring me within the level of your frown,
texto.txt:  since my appeal says i did strive to prove
texto.txt:  the constancy and virtue of your love.
texto.txt:thus policy in love, to anticipate
texto.txt:and ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
texto.txt:the humble slave which wounded bosoms fits!
texto.txt:no, i am that i am, and they that level
texto.txt:which shall above that idle rank remain
texto.txt:nor need i tallies thy dear love to score;
texto.txt:to me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
texto.txt:if my dear love were but the child of state,
texto.txt:as subject to time's love or to time's hate,
texto.txt:weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.
texto.txt:but all alone stands hugely politic,
texto.txt:  which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
texto.txt:which prove more short than waste or ruining?
texto.txt:lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,
texto.txt:o thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
texto.txt:thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;
texto.txt:if nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
texto.txt:but is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
texto.txt:a bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;
texto.txt:i love to hear her speak, yet well i know
texto.txt:  and yet, by heaven, i think my love as rare
texto.txt:thy face hath not the power to make love groan:
texto.txt:although i swear it to myself alone.
texto.txt:thine eyes i love, and they, as pitying me,
texto.txt:have put on black and loving mourners be,
texto.txt:is't not enough to torture me alone,
texto.txt:but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
texto.txt:for thou art covetous and he is kind;
texto.txt:so him i lose through my unkind abuse.
texto.txt:and 'will' to boot, and 'will' in overplus;
texto.txt:thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.
texto.txt:'will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
texto.txt:in things of great receipt with ease we prove
texto.txt:  make but my name thy love, and love that still,
texto.txt:  and then thou lovest me, for my name is 'will.'
texto.txt:thou blind fool, love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
texto.txt:if eyes corrupt by over-partial looks
texto.txt:when my love swears that she is made of truth
texto.txt:o, love's best habit is in seeming trust,
texto.txt:and age in love loves not to have years told:
texto.txt:tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,
texto.txt:let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
texto.txt:though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;
texto.txt:in faith, i do not love thee with mine eyes,
texto.txt:but 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
texto.txt:to any sensual feast with thee alone:
texto.txt:thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:
texto.txt:love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,
texto.txt:hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:
texto.txt:and seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
texto.txt:be it lawful i love thee, as thou lovest those
texto.txt:two loves i have of comfort and despair,
texto.txt:  yet this shall i ne'er know, but live in doubt,
texto.txt:those lips that love's own hand did make
texto.txt:then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
texto.txt:my love is as a fever, longing still
texto.txt:my reason, the physician to my love,
texto.txt:hath left me, and i desperate now approve
texto.txt:o me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
texto.txt:if it be not, then love doth well denote
texto.txt:love's eye is not so true as all men's 'no.'
texto.txt:how can it? o, how can love's eye be true,
texto.txt:  o cunning love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
texto.txt:canst thou, o cruel! say i love thee not,
texto.txt:  but, love, hate on, for now i know thy mind;
texto.txt:  those that can see thou lovest, and i am blind.
texto.txt:who taught thee how to make me love thee more
texto.txt:o, though i love what others do abhor,
texto.txt:  if thy unworthiness raised love in me,
texto.txt:  more worthy i to be beloved of thee.
texto.txt:love is too young to know what conscience is;
texto.txt:yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
texto.txt:lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
texto.txt:triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;
texto.txt:  her 'love' for whose dear love i rise and fall.
texto.txt:in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn,
texto.txt:but thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,
texto.txt:in vowing new hate after new love bearing.
texto.txt:oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
texto.txt:and his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
texto.txt:which borrow'd from this holy fire of love
texto.txt:a dateless lively heat, still to endure,
texto.txt:and grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
texto.txt:against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
texto.txt:but at my mistress' eye love's brand new-fired,
texto.txt:the little love-god lying once asleep
texto.txt:which from love's fire took heat perpetual,
texto.txt:  came there for cure, and this by that i prove,
texto.txt:  love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
texto.txt:lucentio	son to vincentio, in love with bianca.
texto.txt:	i would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
texto.txt:	full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
texto.txt:	lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
texto.txt:	tell him from me, as he will win my love,
texto.txt:	may show her duty and make known her love?'
texto.txt:	bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
texto.txt:	which in a napkin being close convey'd
texto.txt:	may well abate the over-merry spleen
texto.txt:	toes look through the over-leather.
texto.txt:	dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
texto.txt:	above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
texto.txt:second servant	dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
texto.txt:	which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
texto.txt:	as lively painted as the deed was done.
texto.txt:	like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
texto.txt:sly	i thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.
texto.txt:	and slept above some fifteen year or more.
texto.txt:sly	'tis much. servants, leave me and her alone.
texto.txt:	and by my father's love and leave am arm'd
texto.txt:	my trusty servant, well approved in all,
texto.txt:	vincetino's son brought up in florence
texto.txt:	if either of you both love katharina,
texto.txt:	because i know you well and love you well,
texto.txt:hortensia	from all such devils, good lord deliver us!
texto.txt:	for i will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
texto.txt:	good, here's none will hold you. their love is not
texto.txt:	both sides. farewell: yet for the love i bear my
texto.txt:	mistress and be happy rivals in bianco's love, to
texto.txt:	that love should of a sudden take such hold?
texto.txt:	i found the effect of love in idleness:
texto.txt:	if love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
texto.txt:	that made great jove to humble him to her hand.
texto.txt:lucentio	tranio, i saw her coral lips to move
texto.txt:	i pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
texto.txt:	master, your love must live a maid at home;
texto.txt:	and therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
texto.txt:	i will some other be, some florentine,
texto.txt:	because so well i love lucentio.
texto.txt:lucentio	tranio, be so, because lucentio loves:
texto.txt:	and let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
texto.txt:	when i am alone, why, then i am tranio;
texto.txt:	[the presenters above speak]
texto.txt:	my best beloved and approved friend,
texto.txt:	be she as foul as was florentius' love,
texto.txt:	she moves me not, or not removes, at least,
texto.txt:	to give you over at this first encounter,
texto.txt:	suitors to her and rivals in my love,
texto.txt:	have leave and leisure to make love to her
texto.txt:hortensio	peace, grumio! it is the rival of my love.
texto.txt:	all books of love, see that at any hand;
texto.txt:	you understand me: over and beside
texto.txt:	to fair bianca, so beloved of me.
texto.txt:gremio	beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.
texto.txt:grumio	and that his bags shall prove.
texto.txt:hortensio	gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
texto.txt:	my father dead, my fortune lives for me;
texto.txt:petruchio	will i live?
texto.txt:tranio	i love no chiders, sir. biondello, let's away.
texto.txt:	that she's the choice love of signior gremio.
texto.txt:	though paris came in hope to speed alone.
texto.txt:lucentio	sir, give him head: i know he'll prove a jade.
texto.txt:	to make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
texto.txt:	whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
texto.txt:bianca	believe me, sister, of all the men alive
texto.txt:	and for your love to her lead apes in hell.
texto.txt:	then tell me, if i get your daughter's love,
texto.txt:	that covenants may be kept on either hand.
texto.txt:	that is, her love; for that is all in all.
texto.txt:baptista	what, will my daughter prove a good musician?
texto.txt:hortensio	i think she'll sooner prove a soldier
texto.txt:	i love her ten times more than e'er i did:
texto.txt:	myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
texto.txt:katharina	moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
texto.txt:	remove you hence: i knew you at the first
texto.txt:	you were a moveable.
texto.txt:petruchio	why, what's a moveable?
texto.txt:katharina	so may you lose your arms:
texto.txt:	but slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
texto.txt:petruchio	did ever dian so become a grove
texto.txt:	for she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
texto.txt:	for patience she will prove a second grissel,
texto.txt:	'tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
texto.txt:	how much she loves me: o, the kindest kate!
texto.txt:	that in a twink she won me to her love.
texto.txt:	how tame, when men and women are alone,
texto.txt:tranio	and i am one that love bianca more
texto.txt:gremio	youngling, thou canst not love so dear as i.
texto.txt:tranio	graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
texto.txt:	shall have my bianca's love.
texto.txt:	basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
texto.txt:	if whilst i live she will be only mine.
texto.txt:	'sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
texto.txt:	now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
texto.txt:	'c fa ut,' that loves with all affection:
texto.txt:	methinks he looks as though he were in love:
texto.txt:	[exit weeping, followed by bianca and others]
texto.txt:	but where is kate? where is my lovely bride?
texto.txt:	and seal the title with a lovely kiss!
texto.txt:tranio	but to her love concerneth us to add
texto.txt:	we'll over-reach the greybeard, gremio,
texto.txt:gremio	tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
texto.txt:katharina	now, if you love me, stay.
texto.txt:	'tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
texto.txt:	and serve it thus to me that love it not?
texto.txt:	you heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
texto.txt:	than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
texto.txt:	this way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
texto.txt:lucentio	i read that i profess, the art to love.
texto.txt:bianca	and may you prove, sir, master of your art!
texto.txt:lucentio	while you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!
texto.txt:	loved none in the world so well as lucentio.
texto.txt:tranio	o despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
texto.txt:	but one that scorn to live in this disguise,
texto.txt:	forswear bianca and her love for ever.
texto.txt:	ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
texto.txt:	as i have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
texto.txt:	shall win my love: and so i take my leave,
texto.txt:	as 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
texto.txt:	nay, i have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
texto.txt:	that teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
texto.txt:	take in your love, and then let me alone.
texto.txt:	from florence and must here deliver them.
texto.txt:	he does it under name of perfect love;
texto.txt:katharina	a dish that i do love to feed upon.
texto.txt:katharina	go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
texto.txt:	here love; thou see'st how diligent i am
texto.txt:	what, not a word? nay, then thou lovest it not;
texto.txt:petruchio	[aside]  eat it up all, hortensio, if thou lovest me.
texto.txt:	kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,
texto.txt:	i love thee well, in that thou likest it not.
texto.txt:katharina	love me or love me not, i like the cap;
texto.txt:	go, hop me over every kennel home,
texto.txt:	as thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
texto.txt:	sewed up again; and that i'll prove upon thee,
texto.txt:	you are still crossing it. sirs, let't alone:
texto.txt:	of love between your daughter and himself:
texto.txt:	and for the love he beareth to your daughter
texto.txt:	doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
texto.txt:	fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
texto.txt:	allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!
texto.txt:	i may entitle thee my loving father:
texto.txt:	upon the company you overtake?
texto.txt:	[gremio discovered. enter behind biondello,
texto.txt:	need none, so long as i live.
texto.txt:petruchio	nay, i told you your son was well beloved in padua.
texto.txt:	[exit from above]
texto.txt:	this controversy.
texto.txt:vincentio	lives my sweet son?
texto.txt:lucentio	love wrought these miracles. bianca's love
texto.txt:katharina	nay, i will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.
texto.txt:	to smile at scapes and perils overblown.
texto.txt:	and thou, hortensio, with thy loving widow,
texto.txt:	my banquet is to close our stomachs up,
texto.txt:	i'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
texto.txt:petruchio	marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
texto.txt:	to wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
texto.txt:	a woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
texto.txt:	thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
texto.txt:	but love, fair looks and true obedience;
texto.txt:	and graceless traitor to her loving lord?

texto.txt:	should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
texto.txt:	and this soft courage makes your followers faint.
texto.txt:	before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
texto.txt:warwick	'twas not your valour, clifford, drove me thence.
texto.txt:queen margaret	defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
texto.txt:	these words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
texto.txt:	here on my knee i vow to god above,
texto.txt:	till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
texto.txt:richard	now, clifford, i have singled thee alone:
texto.txt:clifford	now, richard, i am with thee here alone:
texto.txt:	[alarum. enter king henry vi alone]
texto.txt:	how many years a mortal man may live.
texto.txt:	pass'd over to the end they were created,
texto.txt:	ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
texto.txt:king henry vi	woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
texto.txt:	if you contend, a thousand lives must wither.
texto.txt:king henry vi	sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
texto.txt:	not that i fear to stay, but love to go
texto.txt:	o lancaster, i fear thy overthrow
texto.txt:	my love and fear glued many friends to thee;
texto.txt:richard	thou didst love york, and i am son to york.
texto.txt:	and in this covert will we make our stand,
texto.txt:second keeper	i'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
texto.txt:king henry vi	from scotland am i stol'n, even of pure love,
texto.txt:	the worthy gentleman did lose his life.
texto.txt:	fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.
texto.txt:king edward iv	'twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
texto.txt:king edward iv	now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
texto.txt:lady grey	ay, full as dearly as i love myself.
texto.txt:king edward iv	an easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
texto.txt:king edward iv	but stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love i mean.
texto.txt:lady grey	the fruits of love i mean, my loving liege.
texto.txt:	what love, think'st thou, i sue so much to get?
texto.txt:lady grey	my love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
texto.txt:	that love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
texto.txt:king edward iv	no, by my troth, i did not mean such love.
texto.txt:	all her perfections challenge sovereignty:
texto.txt:	and she shall be my love, or else my queen.--
texto.txt:	but far unfit to be a sovereign.
texto.txt:	and that is, to enjoy thee for my love.
texto.txt:	why, then, i do but dream on sovereignty;
texto.txt:	why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
texto.txt:	and am i then a man to be beloved?
texto.txt:	and, whiles i live, to account this world but hell,
texto.txt:	for many lives stand between me and home:
texto.txt:	still ride in triumph over all mischance.
texto.txt:	that henry, sole possessor of my love,
texto.txt:	and forced to live in scotland a forlorn;
texto.txt:	for this is he that moves both wind and tide.
texto.txt:	my lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
texto.txt:	i come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
texto.txt:	to tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;
texto.txt:	springs not from edward's well-meant honest love,
texto.txt:	for how can tyrants safely govern home,
texto.txt:	to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
texto.txt:	that henry liveth still: but were he dead,
texto.txt:	tell me for truth the measure of his love
texto.txt:	that this his love was an eternal plant,
texto.txt:warwick	henry now lives in scotland at his ease,
texto.txt:	where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
texto.txt:	thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
texto.txt:	this proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty.
texto.txt:queen margaret	warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
texto.txt:queen margaret	renowned prince, how shall poor henry live,
texto.txt:	that lewis of france is sending over masquers
texto.txt:bona	tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
texto.txt:	shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
texto.txt:	yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.
texto.txt:	unto the brother of your loving bride;
texto.txt:king edward iv	my love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
texto.txt:	and their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
texto.txt:	nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,
texto.txt:post	my sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,
texto.txt:	that lewis of france is sending over masquers
texto.txt:	'tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
texto.txt:post	ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in
texto.txt:	i may not prove inferior to yourself.
texto.txt:	you that love me and warwick, follow me.
texto.txt:	stay not for the love of edward, but the crown.
texto.txt:	tell me if you love warwick more than me?
texto.txt:montague	so god help montague as he proves true!
texto.txt:	now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,
texto.txt:	hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
texto.txt:	and now what rests but, in night's coverture,
texto.txt:	so we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
texto.txt:	that his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
texto.txt:	richard and hastings fly over the stage]
texto.txt:	alas! how should you govern any kingdom,
texto.txt:	though fortune's malice overthrow my state,
texto.txt:rivers	then is my sovereign slain?
texto.txt:	warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.
texto.txt:	for love of edward's offspring in my womb:
texto.txt:	stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?
texto.txt:lieutenant	subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
texto.txt:	i here resign my government to thee,
texto.txt:	adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
texto.txt:	that no dissension hinder government:
texto.txt:warwick	what answers clarence to his sovereign's will?
texto.txt:	i mean, in bearing weight of government,
texto.txt:clarence	it shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
texto.txt:	this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
texto.txt:	but let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
texto.txt:	as being well content with that alone.
texto.txt:	by what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
texto.txt:montague	ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
texto.txt:all	long live edward the fourth!
texto.txt:	above the border of this horizon,
texto.txt:	and thou, brave oxford, wondrous well beloved,
texto.txt:	my sovereign, with the loving citizens,
texto.txt:	farewell, my sovereign.
texto.txt:king henry vi	sweet oxford, and my loving montague,
texto.txt:warwick	farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at coventry.

texto.txt:	it shows but little love or judgment in him:
texto.txt:	thrive, give him over: must i take the cure upon me?
texto.txt:	so it may prove an argument of laughter
texto.txt:	politic love.
texto.txt:	is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.
texto.txt:	your master's confidence was above mine;

texto.txt:aaron	[aside]  clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep
texto.txt:	that for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
texto.txt:	i love lavinia more than all the world.
texto.txt:	and cannot brook competitors in love?
texto.txt:	would i propose to achieve her whom i love.
texto.txt:	she is lavinia, therefore must be loved.
texto.txt:	than this lavinia, bassianus' love.
texto.txt:	there will the lovely roman ladies troop:
texto.txt:	and wake the emperor and his lovely bride
texto.txt:scene iii	a lonely part of the forest.
texto.txt:tamora	my lovely aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,
texto.txt:aaron	madam, though venus govern your desires,
texto.txt:	saturn is dominator over mine:
texto.txt:	his philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
texto.txt:	which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
texto.txt:	who hath abandoned her holy groves
texto.txt:	jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
texto.txt:	and let her joy her raven-colour'd love;
texto.txt:demetrius	how now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
texto.txt:	revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
texto.txt:	let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
texto.txt:chiron	what, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
texto.txt:	the lion moved with pity did endure
texto.txt:	the worse to her, the better loved of me.
texto.txt:	now will i hence to seek my lovely moor,
texto.txt:	whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,
texto.txt:	as fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?
texto.txt:	from this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?
texto.txt:martius	to prove thou hast a true-divining heart,
texto.txt:martius	we know not where you left him all alive;
texto.txt:	which overshades the mouth of that same pit
texto.txt:	how easily murder is discovered!
texto.txt:	accursed if the fault be proved in them,--
texto.txt:saturninus	if it be proved! you see it is apparent.
texto.txt:	to answer their suspicion with their lives.
texto.txt:	as have thy love? why dost not speak to me?
texto.txt:	but, sure, some tereus hath deflowered thee,
texto.txt:	sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
texto.txt:	fair philomela, she but lost her tongue,
texto.txt:	but, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;
texto.txt:	that could have better sew'd than philomel.
texto.txt:	now i behold thy lively body so?
texto.txt:	sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,
texto.txt:	will send thee hither both thy sons alive;
texto.txt:	and therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
texto.txt:	now let me show a brother's love to thee.
texto.txt:	and never, whilst i live, deceive men so:
texto.txt:marcus andronicus	but yet let reason govern thy lament.
texto.txt:	then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
texto.txt:	become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
texto.txt:	then give me leave, for losers will have leave
texto.txt:	and, if you love me, as i think you do,
texto.txt:	the wofull'st man that ever lived in rome:
texto.txt:	but now nor lucius nor lavinia lives
texto.txt:	if lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;
texto.txt:marcus andronicus	alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
texto.txt:	i'll to thy closet; and go read with thee
texto.txt:titus andronicus	she loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
texto.txt:	loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,
texto.txt:	[lavinia turns over with her stumps the books which
texto.txt:marcus andronicus	for love of her that's gone,
texto.txt:	this is the tragic tale of philomel,
texto.txt:	ravish'd and wrong'd, as philomela was,
texto.txt:	apollo, pallas, jove, or mercury,
texto.txt:	what god will have discover'd for revenge;
texto.txt:	you are a young huntsman, marcus; let it alone;
texto.txt:young lucius	and, uncle, so will i, an if i live.
texto.txt:	he hath some message to deliver us.
texto.txt:demetrius	gramercy, lovely lucius: what's the news?
texto.txt:chiron	a charitable wish and full of love.
texto.txt:	for our beloved mother in her pains.
texto.txt:aaron	[aside]  pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
texto.txt:	she is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd.
texto.txt:chiron	it shall not live.
texto.txt:	although she lave them hourly in the flood.
texto.txt:	the close enacts and counsels of the heart!
texto.txt:	look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,
texto.txt:	and no one else but the deliver'd empress.
texto.txt:	shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,
texto.txt:	not far, one muli lives, my countryman;
texto.txt:	come on, you thick lipp'd slave, i'll bear you hence;
texto.txt:	i pray you, deliver him this petition;
texto.txt:	he thinks, with jove in heaven, or somewhere else,
texto.txt:	we will solicit heaven and move the gods
texto.txt:	'ad jovem,' that's for you: here, 'ad apollinem:'
texto.txt:	your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to
texto.txt:titus andronicus	tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor
texto.txt:	deliver a supplication?
texto.txt:	then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and
texto.txt:clown	i warrant you, sir, let me alone.
texto.txt:	an emperor in rome thus overborne,
texto.txt:	his sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
texto.txt:	see, here's to jove, and this to mercury;
texto.txt:	but if i live, his feigned ecstasies
texto.txt:	but he and his shall know that justice lives
texto.txt:	cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
texto.txt:tamora	my gracious lord, my lovely saturnine,
texto.txt:	high-witted tamora to gloze with all:
texto.txt:	in hope thyself should govern rome and me.
texto.txt:	as flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:
texto.txt:	'tis he the common people love so much;
texto.txt:	myself hath often over-heard them say,
texto.txt:lucius	approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
texto.txt:	led by their master to the flowered fields,
texto.txt:	'peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
texto.txt:	say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey
texto.txt:	thy child shall live, and i will see it nourish'd.
texto.txt:	'twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak;
texto.txt:	unless thou swear to me my child shall live.

texto.txt:	stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
texto.txt:	for worse than philomel you used my daughter,
texto.txt:	to make this banquet; which i wish may prove
texto.txt:lucius	away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!
texto.txt:	for peace, for love, for league, and good to rome:
texto.txt:	because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?
texto.txt:	a pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,
texto.txt:	to love-sick dido's sad attending ear
texto.txt:	when it should move you to attend me most,
texto.txt:	of this was tamora delivered;
texto.txt:	the villain is alive in titus' house,
texto.txt:all	lucius, all hail, rome's gracious governor!
texto.txt:lucius	thanks, gentle romans: may i govern so,
texto.txt:marcus andronicus	tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
texto.txt:	to melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:
texto.txt:	sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:
texto.txt:	in that respect, then, like a loving child,
texto.txt:	would i were dead, so you did live again!
texto.txt:lucius	some loving friends convey the emperor hence,
texto.txt:	be closed in our household's monument.
texto.txt:king richard ii	tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
texto.txt:	my gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
texto.txt:	in the devotion of a subject's love,
texto.txt:	too good to be so and too bad to live,
texto.txt:	and wish, so please my sovereign, ere i move,
texto.txt:	what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.
texto.txt:	and when i mount, alive may i not light,
texto.txt:henry bolingbroke	look, what i speak, my life shall prove it true;
texto.txt:	besides i say and will in battle prove,
texto.txt:thomas mowbray	o, let my sovereign turn away his face
texto.txt:	for that my sovereign liege was in my debt
texto.txt:	upon this overweening traitor's foot,
texto.txt:	to prove myself a loyal gentleman

texto.txt:john of gaunt	sister, farewell; i must to coventry:
texto.txt:scene iii	the lists at coventry.
texto.txt:	to prove him, in defending of myself,
texto.txt:	to prove, by god's grace and my body's valour,
texto.txt:henry bolingbroke	lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
texto.txt:	and loving farewell of our several friends.
texto.txt:	my loving lord, i take my leave of you;
texto.txt:	to reach at victory above my head,
texto.txt:	rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.
texto.txt:	there lives or dies, true to king richard's throne,

texto.txt:	feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
texto.txt:	and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
texto.txt:	throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
texto.txt:	prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
texto.txt:	behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
texto.txt:	than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!
texto.txt:	so high above his limits swells the rage
texto.txt:	of bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
texto.txt:sir stephen scroop	sweet love, i see, changing his property,
texto.txt:	our lands, our lives and all are bolingbroke's,
texto.txt:	which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
texto.txt:	cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
texto.txt:	i live with bread like you, feel want,
texto.txt:	this ague fit of fear is over-blown;
texto.txt:	a king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
texto.txt:	discharge my followers: let them hence away,
texto.txt:	into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
texto.txt:	but ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
texto.txt:	shall ill become the flower of england's face,
texto.txt:	the king shall be contented: must he lose
texto.txt:	may hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
texto.txt:	for on my heart they tread now whilst i live;
texto.txt:	give richard leave to live till richard die?
texto.txt:	[exeunt from above]
texto.txt:	me rather had my heart might feel your love
texto.txt:	as my true service shall deserve your love.
texto.txt:	tears show their love, but want their remedies.
texto.txt:	all must be even in our government.
texto.txt:	the soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.
texto.txt:	is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
texto.txt:	lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
texto.txt:	they might have lived to bear and he to taste
texto.txt:	we lop away, that bearing boughs may live:
texto.txt:	scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
texto.txt:	in all this presence that hath moved me so.
texto.txt:duke of aumerle	thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.
texto.txt:	to prove it on thee to the extremest point
texto.txt:	over the glittering helmet of my foe!
texto.txt:	if i dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
texto.txt:bishop of carlisle	as surely as i live, my lord.
texto.txt:	and long live henry, fourth of that name!
texto.txt:	it will the woefullest division prove
texto.txt:	little are we beholding to your love,
texto.txt:	long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit,
texto.txt:	committed by your person and your followers
texto.txt:	have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,
texto.txt:	made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
texto.txt:	like to my followers in prosperity,
texto.txt:	and wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
texto.txt:	our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
texto.txt:	the love of wicked men converts to fear;
texto.txt:king richard ii	ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
texto.txt:northumberland	that were some love but little policy.
texto.txt:	where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
texto.txt:	bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
texto.txt:	treason! foul treason! villain! traitor! slave!
texto.txt:	and yet i love him.
texto.txt:	if any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
texto.txt:	and from the common'st creature pluck a glove,
texto.txt:	to have some conference with your grace alone.
texto.txt:henry bolingbroke	withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
texto.txt:	to win thy after-love i pardon thee.
texto.txt:	shall i for love speak treason to thy face?
texto.txt:	recover breath; tell us how near is danger,
texto.txt:	fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
texto.txt:	forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
texto.txt:	thy overflow of good converts to bad,
texto.txt:	mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
texto.txt:	the traitor lives, the true man's put to death.
texto.txt:	this let alone will all the rest confound.
texto.txt:	love loving not itself none other can.
texto.txt:	pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.
texto.txt:	they shall not live within this world, i swear,
texto.txt:	your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.
texto.txt:	this prison where i live unto the world:
texto.txt:	my brain i'll prove the female to my soul,
texto.txt:	that they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
texto.txt:	so is it in the music of men's lives.
texto.txt:	for 'tis a sign of love; and love to richard
texto.txt:	that brings me food to make misfortune live?
texto.txt:king richard ii	if thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.
texto.txt:	that sought at oxford thy dire overthrow.
texto.txt:	so as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:
texto.txt:henry bolingbroke	they love not poison that do poison need,
texto.txt:	i hate the murderer, love him murdered.
texto.txt:lord lovel	(lovel:)
texto.txt:	i, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
texto.txt:	and therefore, since i cannot prove a lover,
texto.txt:	i am determined to prove a villain
texto.txt:	this day should clarence closely be mew'd up,
texto.txt:	have moved his highness to commit me now.
texto.txt:	from whence this present day he is deliver'd?
texto.txt:	lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
texto.txt:	to be her men and wear her livery:
texto.txt:	were best he do it secretly, alone.
texto.txt:	simple, plain clarence! i do love thee so,
texto.txt:	but who comes here? the new-deliver'd hastings?
texto.txt:	but i shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
texto.txt:	and overmuch consumed his royal person:
texto.txt:	he cannot live, i hope; and must not die
texto.txt:	clarence hath not another day to live:
texto.txt:	the which will i; not all so much for love
texto.txt:	as for another secret close intent,
texto.txt:	clarence still breathes; edward still lives and reigns:
texto.txt:	or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
texto.txt:	thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
texto.txt:	which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
texto.txt:	but dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
texto.txt:lady anne	why, then he is alive.
texto.txt:	and fall somewhat into a slower method,
texto.txt:	so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
texto.txt:	to be revenged on him that loveth you.
texto.txt:gloucester	he lives that loves thee better than he could.
texto.txt:	that hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
texto.txt:	shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
texto.txt:gloucester	but shall i live in hope?
texto.txt:lady anne	all men, i hope, live so.
texto.txt:	even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
texto.txt:	a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
texto.txt:	and then return lamenting to my love.
texto.txt:	will soon recover his accustom'd health.
texto.txt:	a man that loves not me, nor none of you.
texto.txt:	and loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
texto.txt:	that i, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
texto.txt:	by holy paul, they love his grace but lightly
texto.txt:	cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
texto.txt:	the ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
texto.txt:	which here you urge to prove us enemies,
texto.txt:	that henry's death, my lovely edward's death,
texto.txt:	outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
texto.txt:	long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
texto.txt:	that none of you may live your natural age,
texto.txt:	thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
texto.txt:	no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
texto.txt:	the slave of nature and the son of hell!
texto.txt:	lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
texto.txt:queen margaret	foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
texto.txt:	what 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
texto.txt:	and in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
texto.txt:	live each of you the subjects to his hate,
texto.txt:	may move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
texto.txt:	struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
texto.txt:	yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
texto.txt:brakenbury	i am, in this, commanded to deliver
texto.txt:second murderer	so i am, to let him live.
texto.txt:	dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
texto.txt:	well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
texto.txt:first murderer	take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
texto.txt:	unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
texto.txt:clarence	my brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
texto.txt:first murderer	thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
texto.txt:clarence	oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
texto.txt:	i am his brother, and i love him well.
texto.txt:clarence	o, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
texto.txt:	and charged us from his soul to love each other,
texto.txt:	that he would labour my delivery.
texto.txt:second murderer	why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
texto.txt:	dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
texto.txt:	and with my hand i seal my true heart's love.
texto.txt:hastings	so prosper i, as i swear perfect love!
texto.txt:rivers	and i, as i love hastings with my heart!
texto.txt:	wife, love lord hastings, let him kiss your hand;
texto.txt:king edward iv	dorset, embrace him; hastings, love lord marquess.
texto.txt:dorset	this interchange of love, i here protest,
texto.txt:	but with all duteous love
texto.txt:	with hate in those where i expect most love!
texto.txt:gloucester	good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
texto.txt:	made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
texto.txt:gloucester	a blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
texto.txt:	i hate it, and desire all good men's love.
texto.txt:	i do not know that englishman alive
texto.txt:	my sovereign liege, i do beseech your majesty
texto.txt:gloucester	why, madam, have i offer'd love for this
texto.txt:dorset	a boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
texto.txt:dorset	the forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
texto.txt:	and shall the same give pardon to a slave?
texto.txt:	who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
texto.txt:	and said, 'dear brother, live, and be a king'?
texto.txt:	come, hastings, help me to my closet.
texto.txt:	if that our noble father be alive?
texto.txt:	as loath to lose him, not your father's death;
texto.txt:duchess of york	peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
texto.txt:	and he would love me dearly as his child.
texto.txt:	if you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
texto.txt:	and lived by looking on his images:
texto.txt:	to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!
texto.txt:	that i, being govern'd by the watery moon,
texto.txt:	let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
texto.txt:	love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
texto.txt:	now cheer each other in each other's love
texto.txt:	by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
texto.txt:	i fear, i fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
texto.txt:third citizen	woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
texto.txt:second citizen	in him there is a hope of government,
texto.txt:	no doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
texto.txt:	hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
texto.txt:	because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
texto.txt:messenger	the sum of all i can, i have disclosed;
texto.txt:	clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
texto.txt:gloucester	welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
texto.txt:	methinks the truth should live from age to age,
texto.txt:	live long.
texto.txt:gloucester	i say, without characters, fame lives long.
texto.txt:	his wit set down to make his valour live
texto.txt:	for now he lives in fame, though not in life.
texto.txt:prince edward	an if i live until i be a man,
texto.txt:	or die a soldier, as i lived a king.
texto.txt:prince edward	richard of york! how fares our loving brother?
texto.txt:gloucester	he may command me as my sovereign;
texto.txt:gloucester	nor none that live, i hope.
texto.txt:prince edward	an if they live, i hope i need not fear.
texto.txt:	as closely to conceal what we impart:
texto.txt:catesby	he for his father's sake so loves the prince,
texto.txt:	the earldom of hereford, and the moveables
texto.txt:	i live to look upon their tragedy.
texto.txt:	pray god, i say, i prove a needless coward!
texto.txt:vaughan	you live that shall cry woe for this after.
texto.txt:ratcliff	dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
texto.txt:	ely, ratcliff, lovel, with others, and take their
texto.txt:	lord hastings, you and he are near in love.
texto.txt:hastings	i thank his grace, i know he loves me well;
texto.txt:	i have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
texto.txt:	his lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
texto.txt:	as he will lose his head ere give consent
texto.txt:	shall lose the royalty of england's throne.
texto.txt:	that can less hide his love or hate than he;
texto.txt:hastings	the tender love i bear your grace, my lord,
texto.txt:	lovel and ratcliff, look that it be done:
texto.txt:	the rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
texto.txt:	[exeunt all but hastings, ratcliff, and lovel]
texto.txt:	lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
texto.txt:lovel	come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
texto.txt:gloucester	be patient, they are friends, ratcliff and lovel.
texto.txt:	[enter lovel and ratcliff, with hastings' head]
texto.txt:lovel	here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
texto.txt:gloucester	so dear i loved the man, that i must weep.
texto.txt:	he lived from all attainder of suspect.
texto.txt:buckingham	well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
texto.txt:	that ever lived.
texto.txt:	we live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
texto.txt:	which now the loving haste of these our friends,
texto.txt:	moreover, urge his hateful luxury
texto.txt:	because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
texto.txt:gloucester	go, lovel, with all speed to doctor shaw;
texto.txt:	that it may be this day read over in paul's.
texto.txt:	eleven hours i spent to write it over,
texto.txt:	and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings,
texto.txt:	i bid them that did love their country's good
texto.txt:	when he had done, some followers of mine own,
texto.txt:	at the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
texto.txt:	'this general applause and loving shout
texto.txt:	argues your wisdoms and your love to richard:'
texto.txt:	and no worldly suit would he be moved,
texto.txt:	take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
texto.txt:	by heaven, i come in perfect love to him;
texto.txt:buckingham	even that, i hope, which pleaseth god above,
texto.txt:	and all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
texto.txt:	and kingly government of this your land,
texto.txt:	your very worshipful and loving friends,
texto.txt:	in this just suit come i to move your grace.
texto.txt:	to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
texto.txt:	if to reprove you for this suit of yours,
texto.txt:	so season'd with your faithful love to me.
texto.txt:	your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
texto.txt:	yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
texto.txt:	than in my greatness covet to be hid,
texto.txt:	your mother lives a witness to that vow--
texto.txt:	save that, for reverence to some alive,
texto.txt:buckingham	refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
texto.txt:buckingham	if you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
texto.txt:	long live richard, england's royal king!
texto.txt:	on pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
texto.txt:	hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
texto.txt:lady anne	their aunt i am in law, in love their mother:
texto.txt:	and live with richmond, from the reach of hell
texto.txt:	and proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
texto.txt:buckingham	my gracious sovereign?
texto.txt:buckingham	still live they and for ever may they last!
texto.txt:	young edward lives: think now what i would say.
texto.txt:buckingham	say on, my loving lord.
texto.txt:king richard iii	ha! am i king? 'tis so: but edward lives.
texto.txt:	that edward still should live! 'true, noble prince!'
texto.txt:	would tempt unto a close exploit of death?
texto.txt:	i will take order for her keeping close.
texto.txt:tyrrel	           prove me, my gracious sovereign.
texto.txt:	and i will love thee, and prefer thee too.
texto.txt:	the earldom of hereford and the moveables
texto.txt:	i should not live long after i saw richmond.
texto.txt:	all hail, my sovereign liege!
texto.txt:	the son of clarence have i pent up close;
texto.txt:	jove's mercury, and herald for a king!
texto.txt:	will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
texto.txt:	my unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
texto.txt:	hover about me with your airy wings
texto.txt:queen margaret	hover about her; say, that right for right
texto.txt:	richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
texto.txt:	that i may live to say, the dog is dead!
texto.txt:	tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
texto.txt:	and therefore level not to hit their lives.
texto.txt:queen elizabeth	and must she die for this? o, let her live,
texto.txt:	throw over her the veil of infamy:
texto.txt:	so she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
texto.txt:queen elizabeth	no, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
texto.txt:queen elizabeth	what good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
texto.txt:	to be discover'd, that can do me good?
texto.txt:queen elizabeth	up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
texto.txt:king richard iii	then know, that from my soul i love thy daughter.
texto.txt:queen elizabeth	that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
texto.txt:	so from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
texto.txt:	and from my heart's love i do thank thee for it.
texto.txt:	i mean, that with my soul i love thy daughter,
texto.txt:	if this inducement force her not to love,
texto.txt:king richard iii	say that i did all this for love of her.
texto.txt:	having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
texto.txt:	a grandam's name is little less in love
texto.txt:	of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
texto.txt:	that god, the law, my honour and her love,
texto.txt:king richard iii	say, i will love her everlastingly.
texto.txt:king richard iii	say, i, her sovereign, am her subject love.
texto.txt:queen elizabeth	but she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
texto.txt:king richard iii	then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
texto.txt:	the children live, whose parents thou hast
texto.txt:	ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
texto.txt:	the parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
texto.txt:	to my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
texto.txt:	be the attorney of my love to her:
texto.txt:king richard iii	bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
texto.txt:ratcliff	my gracious sovereign, on the western coast
texto.txt:catesby	first, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
texto.txt:	what from your grace i shall deliver to him.
texto.txt:	white-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
texto.txt:stanley	i know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
texto.txt:	what heir of york is there alive but we?
texto.txt:	where are thy tenants and thy followers?
texto.txt:	when they should serve their sovereign in the west?
texto.txt:stanley	they have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
texto.txt:stanley	most mighty sovereign,
texto.txt:stanley	so deal with him as i prove true to you.
texto.txt:messenger	my gracious sovereign, now in devonshire,
texto.txt:	and he himself wander'd away alone,
texto.txt:fourth messenger	sir thomas lovel and lord marquis dorset,
texto.txt:richmond	fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
texto.txt:	tell me, how fares our loving mother?
texto.txt:	cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
texto.txt:	god give us leisure for these rites of love!
texto.txt:	doth comfort thee in thy sleep: live, and flourish!
texto.txt:	good angels guard thy battle! live, and flourish!
texto.txt:	live, and beget a happy race of kings!
texto.txt:	richard loves richard; that is, i am i.
texto.txt:	alack. i love myself. wherefore?  for any good
texto.txt:	i shall despair. there is no creature loves me;
texto.txt:	what thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?
texto.txt:	more than i have said, loving countrymen,
texto.txt:norfolk	a good direction, warlike sovereign.
texto.txt:	whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
texto.txt:	felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
texto.txt:	lash hence these overweening rags of france,
texto.txt:	these famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
texto.txt:king richard iii	slave, i have set my life upon a cast,
texto.txt:	let them not live to taste this land's increase
texto.txt:	now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
texto.txt:	that she may long live here, god say amen!
texto.txt:	heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must
texto.txt:	in cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'
texto.txt:	as true thou tell'st me, when i say i love her;
texto.txt:	thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
texto.txt:	tell me, apollo, for thy daphne's love,
texto.txt:	is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
texto.txt:	and to the field goes he; where every flower
texto.txt:	and stands alone.
texto.txt:	himself! well, the gods are above; time must friend
texto.txt:pandarus	she praised his complexion above paris.
texto.txt:	him above, his complexion is higher than his; he
texto.txt:pandarus	i swear to you. i think helen loves him better than paris.
texto.txt:pandarus	but to prove to you that helen loves him: she came
texto.txt:	and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
texto.txt:cressida	juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
texto.txt:pandarus	why, go to, then: but to prove to you that helen
texto.txt:	loves troilus,--
texto.txt:	prove it so.
texto.txt:cressida	if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
texto.txt:	names as they pass by; but mark troilus above the rest.
texto.txt:	the flowers of troy, i can tell you: but mark
texto.txt:	porridge after meat! i could live and die i' the
texto.txt:	words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
texto.txt:	that she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
texto.txt:	love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
texto.txt:	therefore this maxim out of love i teach:
texto.txt:	then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
texto.txt:	but the protractive trials of great jove
texto.txt:	in fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
texto.txt:	and make a sop of all this solid globe:
texto.txt:	should lose their names, and so should justice too.
texto.txt:nestor	most wisely hath ulysses here discover'd
texto.txt:	upon a lazy bed the livelong day
texto.txt:	a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
texto.txt:	they call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;
texto.txt:	jove's accord,
texto.txt:	that loves his mistress more than in confession,
texto.txt:	with truant vows to her own lips he loves,
texto.txt:	to rouse a grecian that is true in love:
texto.txt:agamemnon	this shall be told our lovers, lord aeneas;
texto.txt:	and may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
texto.txt:	that means not, hath not, or is not in love!
texto.txt:	to answer for his love, tell him from me
texto.txt:	i'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.
texto.txt:	to overbulk us all.
texto.txt:	are dogg'd with two strange followers.
texto.txt:	two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
texto.txt:thersites	agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,
texto.txt:	sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave.
texto.txt:priam	after so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
texto.txt:	'deliver helen, and all damage else--
texto.txt:	you fur your gloves with reason. here are
texto.txt:	and fly like chidden mercury from jove,
texto.txt:	make livers pale and lustihood deject.
texto.txt:	whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
texto.txt:	and jove forbid there should be done amongst us
texto.txt:	were i alone to pass the difficulties
texto.txt:	now to deliver her possession up
texto.txt:	have glozed, but superficially: not much
texto.txt:	for, i presume, brave hector would not lose
texto.txt:	forget that thou art jove, the king of gods and,
texto.txt:	mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy
texto.txt:	scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
texto.txt:thersites	make that demand of the prover. it suffices me thou
texto.txt:	we dare not move the question of our place,
texto.txt:nestor	what moves ajax thus to bay at him?
texto.txt:	did move your greatness and this noble state
texto.txt:	do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
texto.txt:	if you do say we think him over-proud
texto.txt:	that if he overhold his price so much,
texto.txt:nestor	yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
texto.txt:	cry 'no recovery.'
texto.txt:diomedes	or covetous of praise,--
texto.txt:	and cull their flower, ajax shall cope the best.
texto.txt:servant	at mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
texto.txt:	the mortal venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's
texto.txt:pandarus	my niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,
texto.txt:helen	let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.
texto.txt:pandarus	love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.
texto.txt:paris	ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.
texto.txt:	love, love, nothing but love, still more!
texto.txt:	for, o, love's bow
texto.txt:	these lovers cry oh! oh! they die!
texto.txt:	so dying love lives still:
texto.txt:helen	in love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
texto.txt:paris	he eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot
texto.txt:	thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.

texto.txt:cressida	they say all lovers swear more performance than they
texto.txt:	are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go
texto.txt:	prince troilus, i have loved you night and day
texto.txt:	i love you now; but not, till now, so much
texto.txt:	but, though i loved you well, i woo'd you not;

texto.txt:	to feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;
texto.txt:	of such a winnow'd purity in love;

texto.txt:	which, you say, live to come in my behalf.

texto.txt:	bounds in my father's;' by jove multipotent,
texto.txt:	and signify this loving interview
texto.txt:	your quondam wife swears still by venus' glove:
texto.txt:	and you, achilles, let these threats alone,
texto.txt:	this cressida in troy? had she no lover there
texto.txt:	she was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:

texto.txt:	the fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
texto.txt:	hark, greek: as much as i do cressid love,
texto.txt:andromache	my dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.

texto.txt:	you bid them rise, and live.
texto.txt:troilus	                  for the love of all the gods,
texto.txt:	he is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,
texto.txt:	upon the love you bear me, get you in.
texto.txt:	i come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.
texto.txt:	my love with words and errors still she feeds;

texto.txt:	but, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
texto.txt:	a brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
texto.txt:	to pay this debt of love but to a brother,
texto.txt:	how will she love, when the rich golden shaft
texto.txt:	that live in her; when liver, brain and heart,
texto.txt:	these sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
texto.txt:	away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
texto.txt:	love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
texto.txt:	to a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
texto.txt:viola	who governs here?
texto.txt:	that he did seek the love of fair olivia.
texto.txt:	who shortly also died: for whose dear love,

texto.txt:maria	they that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
texto.txt:	followed the arts!
texto.txt:sir toby belch	she'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
texto.txt:	you call in question the continuance of his love:
texto.txt:duke orsino	o, then unfold the passion of my love,
texto.txt:	and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
texto.txt:	prove fools; and i, that am sure i lack thee, may
texto.txt:	calamity, so beauty's a flower. the lady bade take
texto.txt:	prove you a fool.
texto.txt:olivia	oh, you are sick of self-love, malvolio, and taste
texto.txt:	there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
texto.txt:	man, though he do nothing but reprove.
texto.txt:	son should be a fool; whose skull jove cram with
texto.txt:	draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads
texto.txt:	and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
texto.txt:olivia	sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
texto.txt:viola	it alone concerns your ear. i bring no overture of
texto.txt:	war, no taxation of homage: i hold the olive in my

texto.txt:	lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
texto.txt:	my lord and master loves you: o, such love
texto.txt:olivia	how does he love me?
texto.txt:	with groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
texto.txt:olivia	your lord does know my mind; i cannot love him:
texto.txt:	a gracious person: but yet i cannot love him;
texto.txt:viola	if i did love you in my master's flame,
texto.txt:	write loyal cantons of contemned love
texto.txt:viola	above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
texto.txt:	i cannot love him: let him send no more;
texto.txt:	love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
texto.txt:	'above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
texto.txt:sebastian	by your patience, no. my stars shine darkly over
texto.txt:	leave that i may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
texto.txt:	recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.
texto.txt:	overfar believe that, yet thus far i will boldly
texto.txt:antonio	if you will not murder me for my love, let me be
texto.txt:	kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
texto.txt:	she adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
texto.txt:	she loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
texto.txt:	poor lady, she were better love a dream.
texto.txt:	how will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;
texto.txt:	my state is desperate for my master's love;
texto.txt:clown	would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
texto.txt:sir toby belch	a love-song, a love-song.
texto.txt:	o, stay and hear; your true love's coming,
texto.txt:	journeys end in lovers meeting,
texto.txt:	what is love? 'tis not hereafter;
texto.txt:sir andrew	an you love me, let's do't: i am dog at a catch.
texto.txt:maria	for the love o' god, peace!
texto.txt:	deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
texto.txt:	alone with him: if i do not gull him into a
texto.txt:	his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
texto.txt:	love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape
texto.txt:	love with him.
texto.txt:sir andrew	if i cannot recover your niece, i am a foul way out.
texto.txt:	come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
texto.txt:	for such as i am all true lovers are,
texto.txt:	that is beloved. how dost thou like this tune?
texto.txt:	where love is throned.
texto.txt:	hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
texto.txt:	so sways she level in her husband's heart:
texto.txt:duke orsino	then let thy love be younger than thyself,
texto.txt:	for women are as roses, whose fair flower
texto.txt:	and dallies with the innocence of love,
texto.txt:	not a flower, not a flower sweet
texto.txt:	sad true lover never find my grave,
texto.txt:	get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
texto.txt:	tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
texto.txt:viola	but if she cannot love you, sir?
texto.txt:	hath for your love a great a pang of heart
texto.txt:	as you have for olivia: you cannot love her;
texto.txt:	as love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
texto.txt:	alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
texto.txt:	no motion of the liver, but the palate,
texto.txt:	between that love a woman can bear me
texto.txt:viola	too well what love women to men may owe:
texto.txt:	my father had a daughter loved a man,
texto.txt:viola	a blank, my lord. she never told her love,
texto.txt:	smiling at grief. was not this love indeed?
texto.txt:	our shows are more than will; for still we prove
texto.txt:	much in our vows, but little in our love.
texto.txt:duke orsino	but died thy sister of her love, my boy?
texto.txt:	my love can give no place, bide no denay.
texto.txt:fabian	nay, i'll come: if i lose a scruple of this sport,
texto.txt:sir andrew	an we do not, it is pity of our lives.
texto.txt:	hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for i
texto.txt:	him. close, in the name of jesting! lie thou there,
texto.txt:sir toby belch	here's an overweening rogue!
texto.txt:sir toby belch	shall this fellow live?
texto.txt:malvolio	[reads]  'to the unknown beloved, this, and my good
texto.txt:fabian	this wins him, liver and all.
texto.txt:	jove knows i love: but who?
texto.txt:	lips, do not move;
texto.txt:	am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
texto.txt:	daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
texto.txt:	loves me. she did commend my yellow stockings of
texto.txt:	and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
texto.txt:	on. jove and my stars be praised! here is yet a

texto.txt:	jove, i thank thee: i will smile; i will do
texto.txt:	bond-slave?
texto.txt:viola	save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
texto.txt:clown	no, sir, i live by the church.
texto.txt:clown	no such matter, sir: i do live by the church; for
texto.txt:	i do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
texto.txt:	but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
texto.txt:	words are grown so false, i am loath to prove
texto.txt:clown	now jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
texto.txt:	welkin, i might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.
texto.txt:olivia	          that's a degree to love.
texto.txt:	than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
texto.txt:	i love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
texto.txt:	love sought is good, but given unsought better.
texto.txt:	shall mistress be of it, save i alone.
texto.txt:	will i my master's tears to you deplore.
texto.txt:olivia	yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
texto.txt:	that heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
texto.txt:fabian	this was a great argument of love in her toward you.
texto.txt:fabian	i will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of
texto.txt:	put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
texto.txt:	with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall
texto.txt:	love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's
texto.txt:	not deliver't?
texto.txt:	opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as
texto.txt:	and not all love to see you, though so much
texto.txt:	unguided and unfriended, often prove
texto.txt:	rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
texto.txt:	limed her; but it is jove's doing, and jove make me
texto.txt:	prospect of my hopes. well, jove, not i, is the
texto.txt:	with him: let me alone. how do you, malvolio? how
texto.txt:	live. my lady would not lose him for more than i'll say.
texto.txt:	you not see you move him? let me alone with him.
texto.txt:	if this letter move him not, his legs cannot:
texto.txt:sir andrew	nay, let me alone for swearing.
texto.txt:sir toby belch	now will not i deliver his letter: for the behavior
texto.txt:	clodpole. but, sir, i will deliver his challenge by
texto.txt:	there's something in me that reproves my fault;
texto.txt:viola	nothing but this; your true love for my master.
texto.txt:antonio	one, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
texto.txt:	relieved him with such sanctity of love,
texto.txt:antonio	but o how vile an idol proves this god
texto.txt:	prove true, imagination, o, prove true,
texto.txt:	for him i imitate: o, if it prove,
texto.txt:	tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.
texto.txt:	will prove a cockney. i prithee now, ungird thy
texto.txt:	strangeness and tell me what i shall vent to my
texto.txt:sir andrew	nay, let him alone: i'll go another way to work
texto.txt:sir toby belch	jove bless thee, master parson.
texto.txt:malvolio	i think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
texto.txt:	knavery. if he may be conveniently delivered, i
texto.txt:clown	'she loves another'--who calls, ha?
texto.txt:	as i am a gentleman, i will live to be thankful to
texto.txt:	she could not sway her house, command her followers,
texto.txt:	may live at peace. he shall conceal it
texto.txt:fabian	now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
texto.txt:	that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
texto.txt:	my love, without retention or restraint,
texto.txt:	did i expose myself, pure for his love,
texto.txt:	and grew a twenty years removed thing
texto.txt:	kill what i love?--a savage jealousy
texto.txt:	live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
texto.txt:	but this your minion, whom i know you love,
texto.txt:	i'll sacrifice the lamb that i do love,
texto.txt:	to spite a raven's heart within a dove.
texto.txt:viola	after him i love
texto.txt:	more than i love these eyes, more than my life,
texto.txt:	more, by all mores, than e'er i shall love wife.
texto.txt:	if i do feign, you witnesses above
texto.txt:	punish my life for tainting of my love!
texto.txt:priest	a contract of eternal bond of love,
texto.txt:	attested by the holy close of lips,
texto.txt:	that thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
texto.txt:sir andrew	for the love of god, a surgeon! send one presently
texto.txt:	a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of god, your
texto.txt:sebastian	o, that record is lively in my soul!
texto.txt:	thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
texto.txt:viola	and all those sayings will i overswear;
texto.txt:	a gentleman, and follower of my lady's.
texto.txt:	so it skills not much when they are delivered.
texto.txt:clown	look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
texto.txt:	darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
texto.txt:olivia	see him deliver'd, fabian; bring him hither.
texto.txt:julia	beloved of proteus.
texto.txt:silvia	beloved of valentine.
texto.txt:valentine	cease to persuade, my loving proteus:
texto.txt:	to the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
texto.txt:	but since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
texto.txt:	even as i would when i to love begin.
texto.txt:valentine	and on a love-book pray for my success?
texto.txt:proteus	upon some book i love i'll pray for thee.
texto.txt:valentine	that's on some shallow story of deep love:
texto.txt:proteus	that's a deep story of a deeper love:
texto.txt:	for he was more than over shoes in love.
texto.txt:valentine	'tis true; for you are over boots in love,
texto.txt:proteus	over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
texto.txt:valentine	to be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
texto.txt:valentine	so, by your circumstance, i fear you'll prove.
texto.txt:proteus	'tis love you cavil at: i am not love.
texto.txt:valentine	love is your master, for he masters you:
texto.txt:	the eating canker dwells, so eating love
texto.txt:	even so by love the young and tender wit
texto.txt:	of thy success in love, and what news else
texto.txt:proteus	he after honour hunts, i after love:
texto.txt:	i leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
texto.txt:	made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
texto.txt:speed	this proves me still a sheep.
texto.txt:proteus	it shall go hard but i'll prove it by another.
texto.txt:	wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
texto.txt:speed	if the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
texto.txt:speed	from a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
texto.txt:	your lover.
texto.txt:speed	and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
texto.txt:	be both at once delivered.
texto.txt:	not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
texto.txt:	fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
texto.txt:julia	but say, lucetta, now we are alone,
texto.txt:	wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
texto.txt:	in thy opinion which is worthiest love?
texto.txt:	should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
texto.txt:julia	and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
texto.txt:lucetta	ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
texto.txt:julia	why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.
texto.txt:lucetta	yet he, of all the rest, i think, best loves ye.
texto.txt:julia	his little speaking shows his love but small.
texto.txt:lucetta	fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
texto.txt:julia	they do not love that do not show their love.
texto.txt:lucetta	o, they love least that let men know their love.
texto.txt:lucetta	to plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
texto.txt:	fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
texto.txt:julia	some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
texto.txt:	best sing it to the tune of 'light o' love.'
texto.txt:	o hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
texto.txt:	and here is writ 'love-wounded proteus.'
texto.txt:	and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss.
texto.txt:	some to discover islands far away;
texto.txt:proteus	sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
texto.txt:	here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
texto.txt:	o, that our fathers would applaud our loves,
texto.txt:	deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
texto.txt:	how happily he lives, how well beloved
texto.txt:	lest he should take exceptions to my love;
texto.txt:	hath he excepted most against my love.
texto.txt:	o, how this spring of love resembleth
texto.txt:speed	sir, your glove.
texto.txt:valentine	                  not mine; my gloves are on.
texto.txt:speed	she that your worship loves?
texto.txt:valentine	why, how know you that i am in love?
texto.txt:	like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a
texto.txt:	robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had
texto.txt:speed	ever since you loved her.
texto.txt:valentine	i have loved her ever since i saw her; and still i
texto.txt:speed	if you love her, you cannot see her.
texto.txt:speed	because love is blind. o, that you had mine eyes;
texto.txt:	for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
texto.txt:	hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
texto.txt:valentine	belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last
texto.txt:speed	true, sir; i was in love with my bed: i thank you,
texto.txt:	you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
texto.txt:	one she loves.
texto.txt:silvia	and when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
texto.txt:speed	and that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.
texto.txt:	or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
texto.txt:	herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
texto.txt:speed	ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon love can
texto.txt:	your mistress; be moved, be moved.
texto.txt:	torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
texto.txt:	ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
texto.txt:	alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
texto.txt:	dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
texto.txt:	lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.
texto.txt:panthino	tut, man, i mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in
texto.txt:	losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing
texto.txt:	thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy
texto.txt:	master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy
texto.txt:launce	for fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
texto.txt:panthino	where should i lose my tongue?
texto.txt:launce	lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and
texto.txt:valentine	ay, boy, it's for love.
texto.txt:thurio	that hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
texto.txt:	followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,
texto.txt:	that they live by your bare words.
texto.txt:	he is as worthy for an empress' love
texto.txt:valentine	why, lady, love hath twenty pair of eyes.
texto.txt:thurio	they say that love hath not an eye at all.
texto.txt:valentine	to see such lovers, thurio, as yourself:
texto.txt:	upon a homely object love can wink.
texto.txt:valentine	how does your lady? and how thrives your love?
texto.txt:proteus	my tales of love were wont to weary you;
texto.txt:	i know you joy not in a love discourse.
texto.txt:	i have done penance for contemning love,
texto.txt:	for in revenge of my contempt of love,
texto.txt:	love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
texto.txt:	o gentle proteus, love's a mighty lord,
texto.txt:	now no discourse, except it be of love;
texto.txt:	upon the very naked name of love.
texto.txt:valentine	o, flatter me; for love delights in praises.
texto.txt:	sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
texto.txt:	except thou wilt except against my love.
texto.txt:	disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
texto.txt:	she is alone.
texto.txt:proteus	                  then let her alone.
texto.txt:	because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
texto.txt:	for love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
texto.txt:proteus	but she loves you?
texto.txt:	so the remembrance of my former love
texto.txt:	she is fair; and so is julia that i love--
texto.txt:	that i did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
texto.txt:	and that i love him not as i was wont.
texto.txt:	o, but i love his lady too too much,
texto.txt:	and that's the reason i love him so little.
texto.txt:	that thus without advice begin to love her!
texto.txt:	if i can cheque my erring love, i will;
texto.txt:launce	marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very
texto.txt:	thou, that my master is become a notable lover?
texto.txt:speed	i tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.
texto.txt:	in love. if thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;
texto.txt:	to love fair silvia, shall i be forsworn;
texto.txt:	love bade me swear and love bids me forswear.
texto.txt:	o sweet-suggesting love, if thou hast sinned,
texto.txt:	whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
texto.txt:	i cannot leave to love, and yet i do;
texto.txt:	but there i leave to love where i should love.
texto.txt:	julia i lose and valentine i lose:
texto.txt:	if i keep them, i needs must lose myself;
texto.txt:	if i lose them, thus find i by their loss
texto.txt:	for love is still most precious in itself;
texto.txt:	i will forget that julia is alive,
texto.txt:	remembering that my love to her is dead;
texto.txt:	i cannot now prove constant to myself,
texto.txt:	love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
texto.txt:	and even in kind love i do conjure thee,
texto.txt:	a journey to my loving proteus.
texto.txt:	much less shall she that hath love's wings to fly,
texto.txt:	didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
texto.txt:	as seek to quench the fire of love with words.
texto.txt:lucetta	i do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
texto.txt:	lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
texto.txt:	he overtaketh in his pilgrimage,
texto.txt:	till the last step have brought me to my love;
texto.txt:	with twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
texto.txt:julia	lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
texto.txt:	and instances of infinite of love
texto.txt:	but truer stars did govern proteus' birth
texto.txt:	his love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
texto.txt:lucetta	pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!
texto.txt:julia	now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong
texto.txt:	only deserve my love by loving him;
texto.txt:proteus	my gracious lord, that which i would discover
texto.txt:	which to requite, command me while i live.
texto.txt:	this love of theirs myself have often seen,
texto.txt:	that which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
texto.txt:	for which the youthful lover now is gone
texto.txt:	that my discovery be not aimed at;
texto.txt:	for love of you, not hate unto my friend,
texto.txt:	and i am going to deliver them.
texto.txt:	upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
texto.txt:	more than quick words do move a woman's mind.
texto.txt:	for scorn at first makes after-love the more.
texto.txt:	but rather to beget more love in you:
texto.txt:	for why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
texto.txt:duke	this very night; for love is like a child,
texto.txt:duke	but, hark thee; i will go to her alone:
texto.txt:	and slaves they are to me that send them flying:
texto.txt:	go, base intruder! overweening slave!
texto.txt:	by heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
texto.txt:	but, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.
texto.txt:	foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
texto.txt:	that to close prison he commanded her,
texto.txt:	here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
texto.txt:	hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that
texto.txt:	which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd
texto.txt:	even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
texto.txt:	of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
texto.txt:	as thou lovest silvia, though not for thyself,
texto.txt:	all one, if he be but one knave. he lives not now
texto.txt:	that knows me to be in love; yet i am in love; but a
texto.txt:	'tis i love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, i
texto.txt:	grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.
texto.txt:launce	and thereof comes the proverb: 'blessing of your
texto.txt:launce	close at the heels of her virtues.
texto.txt:launce	i care not for that neither, because i love crusts.
texto.txt:launce	more hair than wit? it may be; i'll prove it. the
texto.txt:	cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it
texto.txt:	is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit
texto.txt:speed	why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!
texto.txt:	unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into
texto.txt:duke	sir thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
texto.txt:duke	this weak impress of love is as a figure
texto.txt:	dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
texto.txt:proteus	longer than i prove loyal to your grace
texto.txt:	let me not live to look upon your grace.
texto.txt:	the love of valentine and love sir thurio?
texto.txt:proteus	ay, if his enemy deliver it:
texto.txt:	she shall not long continue love to him.
texto.txt:	but say this weed her love from valentine,
texto.txt:	it follows not that she will love sir thurio.
texto.txt:thurio	therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
texto.txt:	you are already love's firm votary
texto.txt:	to hate young valentine and love my friend.
texto.txt:	that may discover such integrity:
texto.txt:duke	this discipline shows thou hast been in love.
texto.txt:valentine	then know that i have little wealth to lose:
texto.txt:	such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
texto.txt:	that they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
texto.txt:	therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
texto.txt:	and live, as we do, in this wilderness?
texto.txt:	love thee as our commander and our king.
texto.txt:second outlaw	thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
texto.txt:valentine	i take your offer and will live with you,
texto.txt:	i have access my own love to prefer:
texto.txt:	in breaking faith with julia whom i loved:
texto.txt:	the least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
texto.txt:	yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
texto.txt:proteus	ay, gentle thurio: for you know that love
texto.txt:thurio	ay, but i hope, sir, that you love not here.
texto.txt:	for beauty lives with kindness.
texto.txt:	love doth to her eyes repair,
texto.txt:host	i tell you what launce, his man, told me: he loved
texto.txt:	[enter silvia above]
texto.txt:	return, return, and make thy love amends.
texto.txt:proteus	i grant, sweet love, that i did love a lady;
texto.txt:	assure thyself my love is buried.
texto.txt:	vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
texto.txt:	and to your shadow will i make true love.
texto.txt:	[enter silvia above]
texto.txt:	thyself hast loved; and i have heard thee say
texto.txt:	as when thy lady and thy true love died,
texto.txt:	that i may venture to depart alone.
texto.txt:	'thus i would teach a dog.' i was sent to deliver
texto.txt:	live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. he
texto.txt:	a slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
texto.txt:	deliver it to madam silvia:
texto.txt:	she loved me well deliver'd it to me.
texto.txt:julia	it seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
texto.txt:proteus	not so; i think she lives.
texto.txt:julia	because methinks that she loved you as well
texto.txt:	as you do love your lady silvia:
texto.txt:	she dreams of him that has forgot her love;
texto.txt:	you dote on her that cares not for your love.
texto.txt:	'tis pity love should be so contrary;
texto.txt:	because he loves her, he despiseth me;
texto.txt:	because i love him i must pity him.
texto.txt:	i am my master's true-confirmed love;
texto.txt:	unless i prove false traitor to myself.
texto.txt:	deliver'd you a paper that i should not:
texto.txt:	when she did think my master loved her well,
texto.txt:	which i so lively acted with my tears
texto.txt:	that my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
texto.txt:	for thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
texto.txt:	since she respects my mistress' love so much.
texto.txt:	alas, how love can trifle with itself!
texto.txt:	were full as lovely as is this of hers:
texto.txt:	if that be all the difference in his love,
texto.txt:	if this fond love were not a blinded god?
texto.txt:	thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
texto.txt:	that used me so; or else, by jove i vow,
texto.txt:	to make my master out of love with thee!
texto.txt:	she will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
texto.txt:	if we recover that, we are sure enough.
texto.txt:julia	[aside]  but love will not be spurr'd to what
texto.txt:thurio	but well, when i discourse of love and peace?
texto.txt:	than for the love of reckless silvia.
texto.txt:proteus	and i will follow, more for silvia's love
texto.txt:julia	and i will follow, more to cross that love
texto.txt:	than hate for silvia that is gone for love.
texto.txt:	here can i sit alone, unseen of any,
texto.txt:	they love me well; yet i have much to do
texto.txt:	that would have forced your honour and your love;
texto.txt:	love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
texto.txt:	o, heaven be judge how i love valentine,
texto.txt:	o, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
texto.txt:	when women cannot love where they're beloved!
texto.txt:silvia	when proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
texto.txt:	read over julia's heart, thy first best love,
texto.txt:	descended into perjury, to love me.
texto.txt:proteus	in love
texto.txt:	and love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.
texto.txt:valentine	thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
texto.txt:	i have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
texto.txt:	and, that my love may appear plain and free,
texto.txt:julia	o good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring
texto.txt:	such an immodest raiment, if shame live
texto.txt:	in a disguise of love:
texto.txt:	let me be blest to make this happy close;
texto.txt:	i dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
texto.txt:	his body for a girl that loves him not:
texto.txt:	and think thee worthy of an empress' love:
texto.txt:	the story of your loves discovered:
texto.txt:the first heir of my invention prove deformed, i shall be
texto.txt:hunting he loved, but love he laugh'd to scorn;
texto.txt:'the field's chief flower, sweet above compare,
texto.txt:stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,
texto.txt:more white and red than doves or roses are;
texto.txt:the precedent of pith and livelihood,
texto.txt:earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
texto.txt:over one arm the lusty courser's rein,
texto.txt:nimbly she fastens:--o, how quick is love!--
texto.txt:to tie the rider she begins to prove:
texto.txt:and govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.
texto.txt:wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,
texto.txt:perforce will force it overflow the bank.
texto.txt:being red, she loves him best; and being white,
texto.txt:look how he can, she cannot choose but love;
texto.txt:from his soft bosom never to remove,
texto.txt:yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
texto.txt:'over my altars hath he hung his lance,
texto.txt:'thus he that overruled i oversway'd,
texto.txt:love keeps his revels where they are but twain;
texto.txt:fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime
texto.txt:love is a spirit all compact of fire,
texto.txt:these forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;
texto.txt:two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,
texto.txt:is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be
texto.txt:can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?
texto.txt:that thine may live when thou thyself art dead;
texto.txt:in that thy likeness still is left alive.'
texto.txt:by this the love-sick queen began to sweat,
texto.txt:with burning eye did hotly overlook them;
texto.txt:souring his cheeks cries 'fie, no more of love!
texto.txt:the sun doth burn my face: i must remove.'
texto.txt:what 'tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?
texto.txt:statue contenting but the eye alone,
texto.txt:being judge in love, she cannot right her cause:
texto.txt:stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.
texto.txt:love made those hollows, if himself were slain,
texto.txt:why, there love lived and there he could not die.
texto.txt:these lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,
texto.txt:poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,
texto.txt:to love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!
texto.txt:and now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
texto.txt:he sees his love, and nothing else he sees,
texto.txt:he looks upon his love and neighs unto her;
texto.txt:spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
texto.txt:his love, perceiving how he is enraged,
texto.txt:out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.
texto.txt:that love-sick love by pleading may be blest;
texto.txt:for lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong
texto.txt:an oven that is stopp'd, or river stay'd,
texto.txt:free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;
texto.txt:and like a lowly lover down she kneels;
texto.txt:show'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing.
texto.txt:'o fairest mover on this mortal round,
texto.txt:then love's deep groans i never shall regard,
texto.txt:i pray you hence, and leave me here alone;
texto.txt:but when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee,
texto.txt:'who sees his true-love in her naked bed,
texto.txt:o, learn to love; the lesson is but plain,
texto.txt:i know not love,' quoth he, 'nor will not know it,
texto.txt:my love to love is love but to disgrace it;
texto.txt:they wither in their prime, prove nothing worth:
texto.txt:loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.
texto.txt:remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
texto.txt:to love's alarms it will not ope the gate:
texto.txt:'had i no eyes but ears, my ears would love
texto.txt:or were i deaf, thy outward parts would move
texto.txt:yet should i be in love by touching thee.
texto.txt:yet would my love to thee be still as much;
texto.txt:comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by
texto.txt:for looks kill love and love by looks reviveth;
texto.txt:but blessed bankrupt, that by love so thriveth!
texto.txt:which cunning love did wittily prevent:
texto.txt:but now i lived, and life was death's annoy;
texto.txt:but now i died, and death was lively joy.
texto.txt:o, never let their crimson liveries wear!

texto.txt:chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission:
texto.txt:when he did frown, o, had she then gave over,
texto.txt:foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;
texto.txt:yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.
texto.txt:tell me, love's master, shall we meet to-morrow?
texto.txt:now is she in the very lists of love,
texto.txt:all is imaginary she doth prove,
texto.txt:she hath assay'd as much as may be proved;
texto.txt:she's love, she loves, and yet she is not loved.
texto.txt:being moved, he strikes whate'er is in his way,

texto.txt:to which love's eyes pay tributary gazes;

texto.txt:that if i love thee, i thy death should fear:
texto.txt:whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
texto.txt:or at the fox which lives by subtlety,
texto.txt:mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles
texto.txt:for love can comment upon every woe.
texto.txt:the earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,

texto.txt:having lost the fair discovery of her way.
texto.txt:how love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
texto.txt:how love is wise in folly, foolish-witty:
texto.txt:for lovers' hours are long, though seeming short:
texto.txt:there lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother,
texto.txt:this said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,
texto.txt:and yet she hears no tidings of her love:
texto.txt:who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,
texto.txt:'gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster;
texto.txt:hateful divorce of love,'--thus chides she death,--
texto.txt:who when he lived, his breath and beauty set
texto.txt:they bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower:
texto.txt:love's golden arrow at him should have fled,
texto.txt:here overcome, as one full of despair,
texto.txt:o hard-believing love, how strange it seems
texto.txt:adonis lives, and death is not to blame;
texto.txt:i rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.
texto.txt:thus hoping that adonis is alive,
texto.txt:'o jove,' quoth she, 'how much a fool was i
texto.txt:to wail his death who lives and must not die
texto.txt:till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!
texto.txt:'fie, fie, fond love, thou art so full of fear
texto.txt:no flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,
texto.txt:over one shoulder doth she hang her head;
texto.txt:what face remains alive that's worth the viewing?
texto.txt:the flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;
texto.txt:but true-sweet beauty lived and died with him.
texto.txt:having no fair to lose, you need not fear;
texto.txt:but when adonis lived, sun and sharp air

texto.txt:when loue conuerted from the thing it was
texto.txt:  since why to loue,i can alledge no cause.
texto.txt:thus can my loue excuse the slow offence,
texto.txt:therefore desire( of perfects loue being made )
texto.txt:but loue,for loue,thus shall excuse my iade,
texto.txt:when sommers breath their masked buds discloses:
texto.txt:  and so of you,beautious and louely youth,

texto.txt:  so true a foole is loue,that in your will,
texto.txt:o no,thy loue though much,is not so great,
texto.txt:it is my loue that keepes mine eie awake,
texto.txt:mine owne true loue that doth my rest defeat,
texto.txt:sinne of selfe-loue possesseth al mine eie,
texto.txt:mine owne selfe loue quite contrary i read
texto.txt:against my loue shall be as i am now
texto.txt:my sweet loues beauty,though my louers life.
texto.txt:that time will come and take my loue away.
texto.txt:whose action is no stronger then a flower?
texto.txt:  that in black inck my loue may still shine bright.
texto.txt:  saue that to dye,i leaue my loue alone.
texto.txt:when beauty liu'd and dy'ed as flowers do now,
texto.txt:to thy faire flower ad the rancke smell of weeds,
texto.txt:for canker vice the sweetest buds doth loue,
texto.txt:  then thou alone kingdomes of hearts shouldst owe.
texto.txt:    which death, or love, or fortunes wreck did rayse,
texto.txt:    helpe me mine owne loves prayses to resound;
texto.txt:    so i unto my selfe alone will sing;
texto.txt:    go to the bowre of my beloved love,

texto.txt:    and all my cares, which cruell love collected,
texto.txt:    spread thy broad wing over my love and me,
texto.txt:    lyke as when jove with fayre alcmena lay,
texto.txt:    the whiles an hundred little winged loves,
texto.txt:      like divers fethered doves,
